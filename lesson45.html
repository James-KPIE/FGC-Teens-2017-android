				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Have you seen a big guy despised a small guy? What was your conclusion? Did
    you feel for the small guy, or took sides with the big guy? Probably by
    now, you have determined NEVER to be the small guy. Friend, we are all
    humans, and God loves us, that He gave up His all in his Son for our
    redemption. That God did not introduce a higher, or a more decorated
    saviour, for the upper class, shows the indiscriminate and benevolent
    nature our redemption, and this should exactly determine the value we place
    on one another as human beings, and more importantly as members of the body
    of Christ. How exactly would you describe Jesus’ redemptive work on earth?
    It wasn’t about showing that He was a superior being or that He had all the
    power and could whatever He wanted to do. It was about serving others, “For
    even the Son of Man did not come to be served (as the big guy), but to
    serve (as the small guy), and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mark
    10:45). There’s no playing the big guy, if we are going to be part of the
    Kingdom, service is the way up. This means living our lives for others.
    When you occupy a saving position, meet a need, positively touch lives,
    dear you are truly serving.<strong></strong>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The parable in our text was part of the discussions Jesus had with His
    disciples on the Mount of Olives, close to the end of His time on earth. In
    response to the disciples’ pestering question about the time and signs of
    His return, Jesus narrated a series of apocalyptic events that will signify
    the end times (Matt.24). However, Jesus began to direct their attention to
    a more important concern, which is the kind of attitude they should have in
    anticipation of His coming. In other words, rather than fretting about when
    the last days would be, the disciples should be concerned about what their
    disposition should be in view of His coming. This He did, by narrating four
    parables to them. This parables illustrate Kingdom principles required for
    inheriting the kingdom of Christ. First, the parable of the watchful
    servant (24:45-51), which teaches faithfulness and responsibility; second,
    the ten virgins 25:1-13), which illustrates preparedness; next is the
    parable of the talents (vv.14-30), which teaches productivity and lastly
    the parable of the sheep and goats, which is our focus in this lesson.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Serving the least is serving Christ </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The grandeur and glory that will accompany the coming of Christ and the
    details of that event are not our focus in this lesson. However it is
    important to note that His coming is certain and it will be sudden. He will
    come as a king to judge the righteous (sheep) and the unrighteous (goats).
    His judgement would not be based how much knowledge acquired, wealth earned
    or fame gained. Reward will be given based on service rendered to the “the
    least of these my brothers and sisters” (v. 40, NLT). The phrase “the least
    of these brothers and sisters (brethren)” suggest that Jesus wasn’t
    referring just any poor or needy, but those who are in need in the body of
    Christ. Like the phrase “one of these little ones” (Matt 10:42; 18:6, 10,
    14), Jesus was referring to His disciples—His followers. In other words,
    this is not just about acts of charity or worldly philanthropy, but about
    help rendered to those who belong to Christ. What counts here is not just
    service to others, but service to others that is “unto Him.” This looks
    like what Paul said to the Galatians, “Therefore, as we have opportunity,
    let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family
    of believers” (Gal 6:10) . When Jesus said in helping them, “you were doing
    it to me”, this filial identification with His disciples, recalls the
    principle of Matthew 10:40-42, where to receive the disciples is to receive
    Jesus and it is a cup of water given to “one of these little ones because
    he is my disciple” that will be rewarded. To serve ‘the least of these’ is
    to serve Christ.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Serving the least is Christlikeness </strong>
</p>
<p>
    From the way the judgement was delivered, it would appear that Jesus was
    promoting works of charity as basis for salvation. Didn’t the Bible teach
    that “he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done…” (Titus
    3:5) and that “Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done,
    so none of us can boast about it” (Eph. 2:9)? In actual sense, the
    criterion of judgment is mere charity (which isn’t bad after all), but
    people’s response to the needs of the Kingdom as they have met in those who
    belong to Jesus. Love and kindness are virtues of Christlikeness as we have
    learnt in Lesson 7. The judgment of Christ is based on the expression of
    outward works of love and kindness to who belong to Christ and are
    suffering— hungry and thirsty, cold and naked (no clothes to wear),
    homeless, and sick and in prison. The expression of love and compassion is
    taken as an inherent part of faith and salvation (vv. 35-36). Yes, we are
    not saved by works, but don’t forget that we are God's workmanship
    (masterpiece), created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared
    in advance for us to do (Eph. 2:10). Yes, it is not by works of
    righteousness, but we can’t John’s admonition, “let no one deceive and lead
    you astray. He who practices righteousness [who is upright, conforming to
    the divine will in purpose, thought, and action, living a consistently
    conscientious life] is righteous, even as He is righteous” (1 John 3:7,
    AMP). Good works do not produce good character; good character produces
    good works. The proof of righteousness is therefore in the works it
    produces, just as wisdom is justified by all its works (Lk. 7:35).

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What truths have you learnt about serving the least?
</p>
<p>
    2. What decisions will you be making in view of what you have learnt?
</p>
<p>
    3. Do a list of “the least” in your local church or around you, decide on
    what acts of service you would render to at least one of “the least”.

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        In the light of today’s lesson Burton Coffman well observes: “No
        thoughtful person can conclude that Jesus equated salvation with
        benevolence in the usual sense. It is not mere charity, but help of
        Christ's followers that is highlighted here. If this principle were
        more widely understood and accepted, it would revolutionize [people’s]
        attitude toward the Church. In the final essence, what [people] do to
        His Church, they do to Him. To neglect, flout, or dishonour the Church
        is to do the same to Christ who is the Head of the Church. On the other
        hand, those who support and provide for the church and extend their
        concern and constant aid on behalf of her poor and needy, do the same
        for Christ whose body is the Church.”
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>
        Service to others in Christ is redemptive: the love of Christ is
        expressed by the giver, and experienced by the receiver. Not only is
        service to others in Christ redemptive it also has eternal
        consequences. “For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's
        glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to
        what he has done” (Matt 16:27).
