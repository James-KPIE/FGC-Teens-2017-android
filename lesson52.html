				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ world-wide. Our
    celebration should however not just be merry making as is customary with
    very many, instead it should be a season to see beyond little Jesus in a
    manger in Bethlehem to the sacrificial Lamb of God on the cross at Calvary
    for the redemption and restoration of mankind. This Christmas should
    provoke in us rededication to our Lord and Saviour, as well as quicken us
    the more in the pursuit of God’s business of evangelism. Let our Christmas
    shoes take us beyond our Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria and to the uttermost
    part of the world. He is the best Christmas gift that man can give to a
    fellow man. Let’s give glory to our God as we celebrate Christmas.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    According to studies conducted by Prof. Fred A. Grissom, a professor of
    Religious Studies at North Carolina Wesley College, North Carolina, USA,
    the celebration of the birth of Christ (Christmas) did not exist until the
    middle ages. Its earliest observance is traceable to just before the fourth
    Century when Churches in the East (.i.e. Egypt, Asia Minor and Antioch)
    observed Epiphany (the manifestation of God to the world) where they
    celebrated Christ’s baptism, His birth and the visit of the angels. Early
    in the 4<sup>th</sup> Century however, Christians in Rome began to
    celebrate the birth of Christ. The practice spread widely and rapidly, such
    that by the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> Century, most parts of the Christian
    world began to observe the new festival. No clear evidence remains about
    the exact date of the birth of Christ. The December 25 date was chosen for
    both practical and theological reasons: until Christianity became the
    religion of the Roman Empire, the people in Rome celebrated the pagan feast
    of the ‘unconquerable sun’ on the 25<sup>th</sup> of December, to mark the
    beginning of the return of the sun. When Christianity became the religion
    of the empire, the Church replaced the festival of the sun with the
    festival of the Son – the light of the world. This is the popular origin of
    Christmas.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Birth of Jesus Christ</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As foretold by the Prophet Micah (5:2), Jesus Christ was born in the city
    of Bethlehem. This came to be as a result of Caesar Augustus decree
    requesting that everyone in the then known world (everyone in the Roman
    Empire) be registered, possibly for the purpose of taxes. Joseph took his
    pregnant wife, Mary and they journeyed from Nazareth in Galilee where they
    live to Bethlehem in Judea to be counted. While in Bethlehem, Mary gave
    birth to Jesus in a stable and laid him in a manger, as there was no room
    for them to occupy in the inn. The birth of the Saviour of the world, the
    greatest event in all human history, occurred in the most humble of all
    places. Jesus is the King of kings, but He was neither born nor did he live
    like a king in his life time. God’s children are kings and priests (Rev.
    1:6) but in this life, we must be as Jesus was, humble and simple.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Herald of His Birth</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After the birth of Jesus, an angel came down from heaven to gladly inform
    the shepherds in the open field keeping watch over their flock by night, of
    this historic event. The angel and a multitude of heavenly host praised
    God, saying “glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, goodwill
    towards man.” The shepherds hurried to see baby Jesus, and having done so,
    went about glorifying and praising God and spreading the good news of the
    birth of the Saviour. Jesus charges us to do same – spread the good news of
    the Saviour (Mark 16:15).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. How did Christmas come to be?
</p>
<p>
    2. From the brief history in the advent of Christmas, do you think God is
    interested in it?
</p>
<p>
    3. Jesus is the King of kings, yet in his life time, right from birth, he
    lived a simple and humble life. What lesson can we learn from His attitude?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    1. Jesus Christ was born in a manger. Although He is God, He made himself
    nothing, taking the very nature of a servant (Philippians 2:6-7). This is
    He did to be able to reach out and save the world. Our attitude should be
    the same as that of Jesus Christ. We must come off our high horses and
    humble ourselves so we can reach out to save others for Christ.
</p>
<p>
    2. In the story of the birth, we notice that God chose very simple people
    to witness and spread the event of Jesus’ birth. This is instructive as God
    is no respecter of persons, in appointing people to carry out His purpose.
    You should never think that you are too small or insignificant to God’s
    plan. If He can use those lowly shepherds, He can use you.
</p>
<p>
    3. The shepherds spread the word concerning what had been told them about
    Jesus. In the same manner, we should go out there and keep spreading good
    news about the Jesus event, we have experienced in our lives. This way we
    give God the glory.
