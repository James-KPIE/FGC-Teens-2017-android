				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Every President has a spokesperson saddled with responsibility of
    representing the President’s views on such a vast range of complicated
    issues before a hostile press and the public in general. When Goodluck
    Jonathan was president, it was Rueben Abati, who was his spokesman, and now
    for President Muhammadu Buhari, it is Femi Adesina. When these men stand
    before the press or public, they couldn’t care less about who they are
    facing. They speak with presidential confidence and candour. They air the
    opinion of the one they represent like it is their own. The press may be
    cynical, the public may be incredulous, but that isn’t enough to deter the
    conviction of these men about who they are representing. In the same
    manner, the apostles were God’s spokesmen as they presented the Gospel
    before the Jews and gentiles.<strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    After the incident of Ananias and Sapphira, there was increased fear of God
    and humility in the people. More miracles and healing took place and many
    more people believed the Gospel. The Church became larger still, as crowds
    from suburbs and surrounding towns flowed into Jerusalem to have their sick
    and tormented healed by the apostles. This had become too much for the
    religious leaders, to be precise the Sadducees, who were uncomfortably
    jealous of the popularity of the apostles. The high priests and his
    associates moved to arrest and jail the apostles, but the angel of God,
    released them miraculously. The next morning when the full council of the
    Jewish elders gathered for a trial of the apostles, they couldn’t find them
    in jail, even though the prisons locks were intact. There hadn’t been any
    jail break and the guards had not been disposed of their weapons. To their
    dismay, they found the apostles teaching the people at the temple courts,
    as the angel had instructed them.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Speaking with Conviction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The apostles were summoned before the council, although quietly, in order
    avoid a tumult from the crowd who were already rooting for the apostles.
    The Sanhedrin didn’t really have anything new to say, except the repetition
    of their earlier ruling (Acts 4:19-20) that the apostles should stop
    preaching Jesus’ name, claiming that their teaching was indicting the
    Jewish leaders of being guilty of the death of Jesus. The Sanhedrin’s
    intimidation tactics wasn’t working at all. They didn’t even get an apology
    from Peter, who spoke up in the same manner he had done before: “We must
    obey God rather than men (5:29)!” If the religious leaders had an
    exaggerated idea of their own importance and power, the apostles were not
    impressed. These were mere men, and the apostles were committed to obeying
    God. The leaders would have been astonished and abashed at the audacity of
    the apostles, having known that they were mere commoners. What changed? It
    is called conviction. The apostles were speaking and acting with
    conviction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Nature of Conviction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Dictionaries usually define conviction as a fixed or strong belief.
    Biblical conviction is deeper than just a strong belief. Having convictions
    is being so thoroughly convinced that something is absolutely true that you
    take a stand for it regardless of the consequences. Howards Hendricks puts
    it this way: “A belief is something you will argue about. A conviction is
    something you will die for!” For the disciples the Gospel was something
    worth dying for, it wasn’t just a matter of identity that they were
    followers of Christ. Peter, who speaking here, was the same guy, who after
    he had denied Jesus thrice, went fishing. That was then. This Peter was
    different. What were the bases of the apostles’ conviction?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Conviction based on relationship with Christ</strong>
</p>
<p>
    First, it was their relationship with Christ. Christ was the object of
    their conviction— not fame, not power. Even the religious leaders
    acknowledged that they had been with Jesus (4:13).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Conviction based on God’s Word</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Second, their conviction was rooted in the truth of God’s word— in
    scriptures and in the authority and validity of what Christ had personally
    spoken to them. The grounding of their conviction in the scriptures could
    be recognized, from Peter’s speech and the disciples’ prayer prior to the
    enrolment of Matthias (1:16-25), Peter’s sermon at Pentecost (2:14b-40b),
    Peter’s speech in Solomon’s portico of the Temple, after the healing of the
    beggar at the beautiful gate (3:12-26), Peter’s speech to the Jewish
    authorities after his and John’s arrest (4:8b-12, 19b-20), the prayer of
    the apostles and their friends, which led to a fresh revival (4:24b-30),
    and the speech of Peter and the apostles to the council, at their second
    arrest (5:29b-32). Their conviction was also based on all that Jesus said
    to them personally as recorded in the Gospels and in Acts—about the Holy
    Spirit (1:5:6), about their empowerment for their mission (1:7-8). It would
    be observed how much the apostles relied on and referred to scriptures (as
    at then the Old Testament Scriptures) as the basis of their thoughts and
    actions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>Conviction based on the effect of the Word</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Peter told the Jewish council, “We are witnesses of these things…” (5:32),
    meaning that they were not just testimonies (whose thinking, words and
    lives affirmed) to the life and teachings of Christ, but they were also
    martyrs as people who had given up their lives for Christ. In other words,
    they were dead to themselves. The sense in which the word is used is
    captured in Paul’s words, “My old self has been crucified with Christ. It
    is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me…” (Gal.2:20). This was made
    possible because the liberating power of the Gospel, which had not only
    transformed the apostles but the many thousands who believed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>E. </strong>
    <strong>Conviction based the Spirit’s empowerment and control</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From the Pentecost on, the Holy Spirit empowered the apostles for great
    exploits that reinforced their conviction about their faith. The Miracles
    and healings wrought by the hands of the apostles through the power of the
    Spirit was a faith booster. Their conviction was also rooted in a
    Spirit-filled life, which exuded the character of Christ. Their love for
    one another, their faithfulness to the word of God and the ministry, their
    patience in the face of persecution, their kindness to their neighbours and
    enemies and every other virtue of the Spirit they exhibited were a proof of
    their faith and validated their message to the world, as God’s
    spokespersons.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Speaking from Commitment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Conviction births commitment. For the apostles conviction meant commitment.
    Commitment is the act of binding yourself (intellectually or emotionally)
    to a course of action. Commitment comes with the courage to act on one’s
    conviction in faith. The apostles would rather obey God even at the risk of
    being executed, as that would have been their fate (v. 33), had it not been
    for the cautionary intervention of Gamaliel, one of the Jewish leaders, a
    Pharisee (vv. 34-35, 40). Having been flogged and sternly warned to desist
    from proclaiming Christ, the apostles departed with joy from the presence
    of the Sanhedrin, because they were counted worthy to be dishonoured on
    account of the name of Christ. In the face of persecution, pain, shame,
    disgrace, and various threatened deaths, they did not cease from preaching
    and teaching the Gospel be it in private or public places. Instead of their
    sufferings whittling down their commitment to the cause of the Gospel, it
    further served as an impetuous (41-42) in advancing it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Having learnt about what conviction is, would you say that your faith is
    based on conviction or cognition (knowledge), and why?
</p>
<p>
    2. What are the likely factors that would dissuade you from boldly sharing
    your faith with your neighbours or school mates?
</p>
<p>
    3. What decisions would you want to take about these deterring factors?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Our faith commitments must go beyond cognition (knowledge) to
    conviction, if we are go to be God’s spokesperson.
</p>
<p>
    2. To speak up for God in an increasingly skeptical world, we need to build
    our relationship, with the Holy Spirit, through obedience to God’s word.
</p>
<p>
    3. To cultivate a life obedience, we must be diligent in the study and
    meditation of God’s word (Josh. 1:8, 2 Tim. 2:15).
