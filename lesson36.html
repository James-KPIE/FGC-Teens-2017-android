				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In Hebrew, a redeemer is the nearest kinsman or what is now known as
    nearest of kin. The redeemer or kinsman-redeemer is saddled with three
    rights, which also could be referred to as roles. First, to buy back the
    forfeited inheritance for an Israelite who, through poverty, had sold his
    land; as Boaz did for Ruth (Ruth 4:3-5); or to hold land in possession for
    an impoverished kinsman until the year of jubilee, when it should be
    returned to the original owner (Lev. 25:10,13-16,24-28). Second, the
    kinsman-redeemer ransoms his kinsman from slavery to the foreigner (Lev.
    25:47-49) and finally, the kinsman-redeemer reserves the right to avenge
    the death of his slain kinsman as a matter of honor.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    At this point in the history of Judah the people were in need of a
    Redeemer. They looked up to God to redeem them from their predicament, but
    there seemed to be no help in sight. They were in a dilemma—they were
    perplexed as to why God was not answering their prayers. They wondered why
    God would not come to rescue them from the assault of their enemies – the
    Assyrians.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Rebellion and Retribution of Zion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    God’s responds to them through prophet Isaiah. He tells them that the
    reason He has not answered their prayers was not due to any lack of ability
    on His part. On the contrary, it was because of their sins: Their hands
    were soiled with blood, and their fingers with iniquity (v.3). They spoke
    lies and mutter injustice (v.3b). They were dishonest, trusting in empty
    and worthless words (v.4). They conceived trouble and concocted immorality
    (v.4). Their feet ran after evil and they rushed to shed innocent blood
    (v.7). Their thoughts were sinful (v.7b). As a result of their sins God
    left them to be invaded and oppressed by their enemies. Their iniquities
    “built barriers” between them and God, and their sins caused Him to “hide
    His face” from them so as not to listen to their pleadings.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Redemption and Restoration of Zion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Hitherto, the people of Judah have had a checkered history of rebelling
    against God, facing retribution and then returning to God. No sooner had
    God granted them pardon, than they returned to their old ways. The circle
    then begins again. This time they really did it, so much that there was no
    one to intercede on their behalf. They couldn’t save themselves. And no one
    could stand in for them. God had to step in to do the Redeemer’s job
    Himself. This goes to show that salvation is of the Lord. Upon the people’s
    acknowledgement of their sins, (vv.12-13) God moves to deliver them, for
    even the lawful captive shall be delivered (Isa. 49:24-25). In the
    immediate, Yahweh delivers his people from the bondage of their captors,
    just like it is expected of a kinsman-redeemer. However, in the ultimate,
    he promises them a Redeemer, who will come to redeem those who turn away
    from their sins. This was referring to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who would
    save them from their sins and the consequences thereof.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways can sin be a barrier between us and God?
</p>
<p>
    2. Of what importance is repentance to God’s redemptive act?
</p>
<p>
    3. In what ways does Christ fulfil the roles of the kinsman-redeemer in our
    lives?

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    <strong>Lesson Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This promise of a Redeemer is not to Israel alone. It is a promise to all
    people who will respond to the call of repentance (v.19). This promise is
    two-fold; first that the Messiah will come to be our Redeemer and second,
    that the Spirit of God will come to be our sanctifier and the seal of our
    eternal destiny (v.21). God’s promised salvation is for all who believe His
    words and with whom His Spirit has entered. David Guzik puts it this way,
    “Jesus Christ is our near kinsman… He is the one who buys us out of [the]
    slavery [of sin]. He is the one who avenges wrongs done to us. He protects
    our inheritance…” What more? His Holy Spirit is given to us as a guarantor
    of our inheritance in Christ. And sometime in the future, the Redeemer will
    come (referring to the second coming of Jesus). He will come to receive all
    those who have asked God’s forgiveness and have been saved through the
    blood of Jesus. Then we would ultimately take possession of our
    inheritance.
