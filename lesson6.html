    than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He
    will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 17 His winnowing fork
    is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into
    his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." - Luke
    3:16-17

</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is an experience that every believer must
    long for. It is a wonderful experience to receive the Holy Spirit. The Holy
    Spirit comes into the life of an individual to empower the person for great
    exploits including witnessing for Jesus Christ.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    John the Baptist’s ministry was making waves, as he went about preaching
    repentance to them. The people thronged to him to be baptized at the
    Jordan, wondering if he was the Messiah. John would not steal the identity
    of the Christ. He took the opportunity to announce to the people that the
    Messiah was coming and that he was going to baptize them with the Holy
    Spirit. John’s audience may not have understood what he was saying, until
    the day of Pentecost, when the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
    came to pass while the disciples were gathered together in the Upper Room.
    It was a dramatic experience as the 120 in the room were all filled with
    the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues they didn’t speak before.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Baptism By John</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the coming of John the Baptist, the Jews were familiar with
    various practices of ceremonial baths and washings, prescribed in the
    Mosaic Law to remove defilement and infection and restore the normal clean
    state (Lev 11-15). Proselytes (non-Jews, otherwise called gentiles, who
    converted to the Jewish religion), were required to be baptized as a
    ceremonial cleansing from defilement in addition to circumcision. Baptism,
    however, became popular with John’s public ministry, hence the appellation,
    ‘John the Baptist’. As a forerunner of the Messiah, John baptized Jews
    repentant of their sins, in response to his call to repentance. His baptism
    was symbolic with his message, which heralded the coming of the Christ and
    invariably the advent of the Kingdom of God. The baptism of the repentant
    symbolized the desire for forgiveness of sin, renouncing past life, and a
    desire to be included in the coming messianic kingdom. That was why John
    emphasized that the Jews who came to be baptized should quit deluding
    themselves with their Abrahamic heritage and “produce fruit in keeping with
    repentance” (Luke 3:8) rather than merely fulfilling a ceremonial cleansing
    rite. Significantly, Jesus who had no need for repentance also came to John
    to be baptized. John at first was reluctant, as he knew who Jesus was and
    felt unworthy to baptize him, but Jesus insisted (Matt. 3:14-15). By
    submitting to John’s baptism, Jesus demonstrated an act of obedience in
    doing the needful. He also validated the ministry and message of John, who
    proclaimed the imminence of the Kingdom of heaven and its Messiah. Jesus
    also stepped forward to be baptized not as an individual but as a
    representative of all who will repent and receive the Kingdom of God
    through Christ. Jesus’ stooping to be baptized by John indicted the
    arrogant and self-righteous Pharisees who refused to submit to the baptism
    of John (Luke 7:29-30). Finally, the baptism was an ample opportunity for
    the divine inauguration of the ministry of Jesus (Luke 3:21-22).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Baptism By Jesus</strong>
</p>
<p>
    John baptized `with water, but John the Baptist himself affirmed that Jesus
    was the one to baptize with the “Holy Spirit and with fire”. Just before
    his ascension, Jesus also told the disciples, “For John baptized with
    water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit” (Acts
    1:5). While the coming of Jesus did not obliterate baptism with water, (as
    it became a Christian rite to symbolize repentance and acceptance of
    Christ), the baptism of the Holy Spirit refers to the endowment of the
    Christian with the power of the Holy Spirit, which is expressed in the
    regenerative work of the Holy Spirit at new birth and a further empowerment
    for living and service in God’s Kingdom. The convicting, converting,
    purifying, enlightening and energizing work of the Holy Spirit in the life
    of the believer is the literal composition of the metaphor to “baptize with
    Holy Spirit and with fire” as used by John in the text. How then is Jesus
    connected to all this? Certainly, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is Jesus’
    prerogative, In John 7:37 we read: “Now on the last day of the feast, the
    great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, 'If anyone thirst, let him come
    to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, "Out of
    his heart shall flow rivers of living water."” And then in v. 39: “Now this
    he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive;
    for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet
    glorified.” In John 15:26 Jesus spoke of the Counselor “whom I shall send
    to you from the Father… he will bear witness to me.” In John 16:13 Jesus
    declares that the Spirit when He comes will guide the disciples into all
    truth, and He will show them things to come.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    :
</p>
<p align="left">
    1. If the baptism of John was for sinners who sought repentance, why did
    Jesus submit himself to John’s baptism, since he had no sin?
</p>
<p align="left">
    2. In what way(s) was John’s baptism preparatory to the ministry of Christ?
</p>
<p align="left">
    3. Read Acts 2:39, how would you respond to those who claim the baptism of
    Holy Spirit ceased after the Pentecost experience with apostles?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    We receive the Holy Spirit the moment we receive Jesus Christ as Lord and
    Savior (1 Cor. 12:13). In Ephesians 1:13-14, we learn that the Holy Spirit
    is the seal of salvation for all believers. This means it is the Holy
    Spirit who guarantees the believer’s eternal destiny. This shows how
    significant the presence and role of the Holy Spirit is in the life of the
    Christian. John’s message and baptism stirred up the people’s hope for the
    coming messianic kingdom, but the baptism of the Holy Spirit qualifies and
    empowers believers for the life of the Kingdom. The key to being baptized
    in the Holy Spirit is by receiving Christ. Like the religious Jews in
    John’s day who were familiar with all the ceremonial rites of the Mosaic
    Law and claimed the right to the heritage of Father Abraham, without
    showing any fruit of repentance, you may also be beclouded into thinking
    you have been in church for a long time. Perhaps you were even born into a
    Christian family, and your parents are church leaders, and you may have
    learnt all the lingoes of church, and practiced how to mutter some
    glossolalia. Quit playing church and get real. Take a reality check and
    establish where you stand with Christ, so you can begin to enjoy life with
    the Spirit.
