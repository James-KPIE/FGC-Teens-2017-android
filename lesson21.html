    <strong>Text: </strong>
    Luke 15:11-24<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse: </strong>
    "When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men
    have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go
    back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and
    against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one
    of your hired men.' - Luke 15:17-19<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    Repenting from our mistakes make way for restoration
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    At the end of this lesson, teens should be convinced and be bold to repent
    from their evil behaviours and rebellion, thereby returning to their family
    and/or the body of believers (i.e. The Church).
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Hebrews 11:6 says without faith, no one can please God. To start a
    relationship with Him, we must believe that He exists and that He rewards
    those who seek (search for) Him diligently (with all seriousness).
    Teenagers are by nature very restless and inquisitive people. They can be
    very rebellious at this age of their life. Thank God, teens who are
    children of God are no longer under the control of the forces of nature
    (except they so choose to yoke themselves) but by the Holy Spirit (Rom.
    8:14).
</p>
<p>
    As children of God, our faith or total trust in God is tested virtually on
    a daily basis. How do we handle such test(s)? The parable of the prodigal
    son told in our Bible passage for this lesson is quite instructive. When we
    fail our test of faith, we must remorsefully return to our God and father
    in repentance from the evil or rebellion we have engaged in. Jesus is
    teaching in that story that God will welcome us back, forgive us and
    restore us. Don’t run away from Him and attempt to hide the mistake or sin.
    You make things worse for yourself and make yourself vulnerable to
    unpleasant circumstances and untold disadvantage. God has seen you. Nothing
    is ever hidden from Him. Return repentant like the prodigal son. God is
    waiting to receive you, forgive you and restore you.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus was out teaching the people on a certain day. Among those gathered
    were tax collectors and other sinners, as well as the Pharisees and
    Sadducees (the Pharisees and Sadducees consider themselves righteous, they
    are quick to condemn others and brand them as sinners). As Jesus taught
    them, the Pharisees complained that it was characteristic of Him to receive
    sinners and even eat with them. So, Jesus told three parables of the lost
    sheep, the lost coin and the lost child to inform and emphasis that he had
    not come for those who claim to be righteous but to call sinners to
    repentance (Matt. 9:13). That when anyone repents of his or her sins,
    heaven rejoices, for the Father is ever ready to graciously forgive and
    restore.

<p>
    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Rebellious Son</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Often, as begin to grow up and make friends, we begin to feel we have come
    of age and need some more freedom from the seeming ‘overprotection’ from
    our parents. We want to take our own decisions, without our parents prying.
    We want to explore life and because our preferences begin to clash with
    that of our parents, we grow restless and begin to rebel. We want nothing
    to inhibit our unbridle freedom. Often times, it turns out that we have
    gotten it all wrong. We take decisions for all the wrong reasons, unheeding
    wise counsel, of our parents, wards or counsellors. We rather listen and
    follow the advice of friends. We then find ourselves in a quagmire of
    misery and regret. This was the case of the prodigal (wasteful) son. He
    rebelled against his father when he decided he had no business serving him
    anymore, he must get his inheritance (even while his father still lives)
    and go away to lead a life free from his father’s attention and protection.
    Certainly, it wasn’t the wise decision.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Repentant Son</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Before long, the prodigal son realized his folly. He had squandered his
    resources and plunged himself into severe lack and hunger. He hired himself
    out as a labourer – talking of the prince making himself a slave due to
    lack of discretion – when he came to his senses. He realized he had sinned
    against God and against his father. He was truly remorseful and repentant.
    He did not waste any further time, but got up and returned to his father in
    genuine repentance. The father, who had been expecting the return of his
    son since he left home, was waiting. Upon sighting his son, he ran to him,
    embraced him and had compassion on him. We find ourselves, sometime, in the
    same state with the prodigal son. We go astray when our faith is tested—it
    isn’t just about rebelling to our parents, but in disobedience to God. We
    let our self-consciousness get the best of us and pitch us against obeying
    God in our decisions and lifestyle. However, God is always willing to
    forgive us, when we repent and return unto Him. He is ever compassionate,
    ever ready to receive and forgive. It is not His desire that any should
    perish but that all should come to repentance (2 Pet. 3:9). Trust Him, when
    you are wrong Him, return in genuine repentance, He will receive you,
    forgive you and restore you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways can our faith as teenagers be possibly tested?
</p>
<p>
    2. Why do we often fall easily into temptations?
</p>
<p>
    3. Read 1 John5:3-5, what does the passage teach us in view of today’s
    lesson?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    1. As our faith in God is tested virtually on a daily basis, we must not be
    reckless, but prayerfully rely on the leading of the Holy Spirit to
    overcome.
</p>
<p>
    2. When we fail our test of faith, we must quickly cry to God in
    repentance. He will receive us, forgive us and restore us.
</p>
<p>
    3. Our memory verse in Luke 15:17-19 says: “And when he came to himself, he
    said, how many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to
    spare, and I perish with hunger? I will arise and go to my father and will
    say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee. And am
    no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of they hired
    servants.”
</p>
<p>
    4. Today’s Bible lesson is on Tested Faith, and we have learnt that
    repentance from our mistakes make way for our restoration. We read Luke
    15:11-24.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assignment</strong>
