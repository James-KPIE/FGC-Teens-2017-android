				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Everyone is conscious of God whether or not they admit it. The Spirit
    applies the truths of God to minds of people to convince them that they are
    sinners. Responding to that conviction brings people to salvation. Once we
    are saved and belong to God, the Spirit takes up residence in our hearts,
    sealing us with the confirming, certifying, and assuring pledge of our
    eternal state as His children. Jesus said He would send the Spirit to us to
    be our Helper, Comforter, and Guide (Jn. 14:16; Rom.8:9; 1 Cor. 6:19-20,
12:13    <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2014.16" target="_blank"></a>).
    The Greek word translated here “Counselor” means “one who is called
    alongside” and has the idea of someone who encourages and exhorts. Jesus
    gave the Spirit as a compensation for His absence, to perform the functions
    towards us which He would have done if He had remained personally with us.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Holy Spirit does not only minister in the capacity of representing the
    Father and the Son. He also has a personal, distinct ministry of His own.
    We know that the Holy Spirit has had a personal ministry through the ages,
    yet it can be said that His personal ministry in this age unlike in the Old
    Testament times, has its separate and positive distinctions. Of the many
    names of the Holy Spirit used in the Bible, there are 90 distinct
    references to the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament alone! This lesson
    explains four names and ministries of the Holy Spirit that relate to teens.
    Those names and works are: Our Helper, Our Comforter, Our Teacher and Our
    Friend.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit is our Helper </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We need the Holy Spirit's help more than we know. How exactly does the Holy
    Spirit help us? Sometimes, we refer to the Holy Spirit as some vague spirit
    being that just hovers around to lead us this way and that. But Jesus is
    very clear: The Spirit is <em>so much more</em>. He is our real and
    necessary Helper and Advocate, sent to assist us in living the Christian
    life. Here are a few ways that the Holy Spirit helps us both for our good
    and God’s glory:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>
        The Holy Spirit helps us pray when we don't know how (Rom.8:26).
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may think we know how to pray, and sometimes we do, but many times we
    don't have a clue what answer to prayer we really need. If you are praying
    wrongly, you won't get the right answers, or perhaps any answer. If you are
    not getting your prayer answered, consider James 4:3.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit helps us pray God's perfect will</strong>
    <strong> (Rom. 8:27).</strong>
    The Holy Spirit has the mind of God. He always knows the perfect will of
    the Father and always gets His prayers answered (1 John 5:14-15). So if we
    know that He hears whatever we ask, we know that we have whatever we asked
    of Him.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as our Comforter </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The word "comforter" is frequently used by Greek writers to denote an
    advocate in a court; one who intercedes; a monitor, a teacher, an
    assistant, a helper. It is somewhat difficult, therefore, to fix the
    precise meaning of the word. It may be translated as advocate, monitor,
    teacher, or helper. We learn particularly from the accounts that our
    Saviour gives of His work that His office was:
</p>
<p>
    A. To comfort the disciples; to be with them in His absence and to supply
    His peace; and this is properly expressed by the word Comforter.
</p>
<p>
    B. To aid them in their work; to advocate their cause, or to assist them in
    advocating the cause of religion in the world, and in bringing sinners to
    repentance; and this may be expressed by the word advocate (Jn. 16:7-13).
</p>
<p>
    C. It was also by the Spirit that they were enabled to stand before kings
    and magistrates, and boldly to speak in the name of Jesus (Matt.10:20).
</p>
<p>
    These seem to comprise all the meanings of the word in the New Testament.
    He shall be your constant guide and attendant. So, being our Comforter
    encompasses all the ministries of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as our Teacher </strong>
</p>
<p>
    References: Neh. 9:20; Matt. 10:19-20; Mk.13:11; Lk.12:12; I Jn.2:7. Our
    Lord Jesus in His last conversation with His disciples before His
    crucifixion said that the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, shall teach us
    all things, and bring all things to our remembrance, whatsoever He had told
    us (John14:26).
</p>
<p>
    Here we have a twofold work of the Holy Spirit, teaching and bringing to
    remembrance the things which Christ had already taught. We will take them
    in the reverse order.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit brings to remembrance the words of Christ.</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    This promise was made primarily to the Apostles and is the guarantee of the
    accuracy of their report of what Jesus said. But the Holy Spirit does a
    similar work with each believer who expects it of Him, and who looks to Him
    to do it. The Holy Spirit brings to our mind the teachings of Christ and of
    the Word just when we need them for either the necessities of our life or
    of our service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit will teach us all things</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is the privilege of each believer in Jesus Christ, even the humblest, to
    be "taught of God." We have a Divine Teacher, the Holy Spirit. We shall
    never truly know the truth until we are thus taught directly by the Holy
    Spirit. No amount of mere human teaching, no matter who our teachers may
    be, will ever give us a correct and exact and full apprehension of the
    truth. Not even a diligent study of the Word either in the English or in
    the original languages will give us a real understanding of the truth. We
    must be taught directly by the Holy Spirit and we may be thus taught, each
    one of us. The Spirit will guide the one whom He thus teaches "into all the
    truth." There are two special lines of the Spirit's teaching mentioned:
</p>
<p>
    1. "He shall declare unto you the things that are to come."
</p>
<p>
    2. “He shall take of Mine and shall declare it unto you.”
</p>
<p>
    This is the Holy Spirit's special line of teaching with the believer, as
    with the unbeliever, Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as our Friend </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. The Holy Spirit reveals to us the deep things of God which are hidden
    from and are foolishness to the natural man (1 Cor. 2: 9-13). The Holy
    Spirit takes the deep things of God which He hath prepared for us, even in
    the life that now is, and reveals them to us.
</p>
<p>
    B. Not only is the Holy Spirit the Author of revelation, the written Word
    of God: He is also the Interpreter of what He has revealed (1 Cor. 3:14).
</p>
<p>
    C. The Holy Spirit will help you find the right words to say in difficult
    situations (Luke 12:11-12).
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Who is this Holy Spirit? Has anyone ever heard about Him before this
    time?
</p>
<p>
    2. What is He going to be like? What should I expect of Him?
</p>
<p>
    3. What does “living with you” concept mean?
</p>
