</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus prayed often: at every point in time in His life. He prayed all
    through His life: at the time of His baptism (3:21), and at the time of the
    choosing of His disciples (6:12). He was often alone praying (5:16; 9:18)
    and also prayed with others around (9:28-29). He prayed for Simon (22:32),
    and He prayed in the garden before His betrayal (22:40-44). He even prayed
    on the cross (23:46). It was on one of such occasions that one of His
    disciples, impressed with Jesus' life of prayer, asked Jesus to teach them
    to pray. It was the format of the prayer He thought His disciples that has
    come to be known as “the Lord’s prayer,” which is Jesus’ Model Prayer for
    believers. Prayer, which may be verbal or mental, is "beseeching the Lord"
    (Exo. 32:11); "pouring out the soul before the Lord" (1 Sam .1:15);
    "praying and crying to heaven" (2 Chro. 32:20); "seeking unto God and
    making supplication" (Job 8:5); "drawing near to God" (Psa. 73:28); "bowing
    the knees" (Eph. 3:14).
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    John the Baptist is here presented to us in this passage also as a man of
    and lover of prayer and not merely a baptiser alone. As followers who do
    not want to pray “amiss” (James 4:3), one of them on behalf of others asked
    the Master, whom John the Baptist has introduced in their presence as the
    Son of God who comes from the Father, to teach them the prayer that the
    Father hears and answers (1 Jn. 5:14). Jesus teaches thus, the principles
    of His model prayer to His disciples, followers and believers.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer Priority</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Just as the disciples have discovered the priority of prayer in their lives
    after their Master, Jesus intimated them of the greater priority: God. God
    must be atop every prayer. Any one praying must know God as a Father. This
    Father has a name and a will (Psa. 138:2). The name of God must ‘hallowed.’
    His will must be done by anyone who wants his prayer answered. Since God,
    our heavenly Father is holy, He must be sanctify holy through our own
    holiness in thoughts, words and deeds. Like our earthly fathers, our
    heavenly Father demands reverence from each of His children that will pray
    to Him.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer Pattern</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This "Lord's Prayer" is rather more of a model or pattern of prayer than a
    set prayer to be recited or offered up. There is no any scriptural special
    form of prayer for general use. Though, in prayer, you can:
</p>
<p>
    - Kneel (1 Kings 8:54; 2 Chro. 6:13; Psa. 95:6; Isa. 45:23; Luke 22:41;
    Acts 7:60; 9:40; Eph. 3:14, etc.);
</p>
<p>
    - Bow or fall prostrate (Gen. 24:26,52; Exo. 4:31; 12:27; Matt. 26:39; Mark
    14:35);
</p>
<p>
    - Spread out the hands (1 Kings 8:22,38,54; Ps 28:2; 63:4; 88:9; 1 Tim 2:8,
    etc.); and
</p>
<p>
    - Stand (1 Sam. 1:26; 1 Kings 8:14, 55; 2 Chro. 20:9; Mark 11:25; Luke
    18:11, 13).
</p>
<p>
    But the patterning of our prayers after Jesus’ Model Prayer is that we
    must:
</p>
<p>
    - Place God who is Spirit and in heaven as our Father over us and our
    concerns. We must bring ourselves and situation under God, His kingdom and
    His Will (Matt. 26:42).
</p>
<p>
    - Trust and depend of God daily for all of our needs and supply at a go
    (Exo. 16:18-19, Phil. 4:19).
</p>
<p>
    - If we don’t want to pray in vain, forgive ‘those who sin against us,’
    before we ask God to forgive us our own sins (Mark 11:25-26).
</p>
<p>
    - Ask for God’s leading and guardian in all things and at all times (and
    particularly away from temptation, sin and Satan)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer Persistence</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In contrast with the man who did not want to be bothered, God wants His
    people to pray to Him (11:9-10). So Jesus encourages His children to be
    persistent in prayer: though not to change God's mind (Psa. 106:15) but to
    be steadfast in praying and to receive their needs. While the first parable
    concerns persistence in prayer, the second parable noted that the heavenly
    Father gives His children what is good for them, not what harms them. Jesus
    noted that natural fathers give good food to their children rather than
    something that would harm them. How much more will the heavenly Father give
    what is good to His own children too.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer’s Powers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. Prayer has a significant power in the cementing of personal relationship
    with God. As God loves us, when we confidently come to Him in prayer, we
    can come always trust and depend on Him to give what we need, and to open
    the door to the future He has in mind for you and me.
</p>
<p>
    B. Prayer and needs! Jesus promises: "Ask and it will be given to you; seek
    and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you" (Matt. 7:7).
    The exhortation suggests deep need and uncertainty. And Jesus' comment is
    intended to assure us that God is eager to listen to our requests and to
    respond. If a human father, who is by nature sinful and bent toward evil,
    will act lovingly toward his children, how much more then God, the perfect
    Father, will act toward us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    1. Reading 1 John 5:14, what is God’s will, and what does it mean to pray
    according to His will?
</p>
<p align="left">
    2. Does God know what we are going through, if yes, why is He yet waiting
    for us to pray about it unto Him?
</p>
<p align="left">
    3. Why can’t the children of God pray according to their own will?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    The lesson of Jesus’ Model prayer is not the good recitation of the Lord’s
    prayer in Greek or Latin, but that the kingdom of God and His Will must be
    allowed free rule and rein over our own kingdom and will on earth as
    nothing contest with the will of God in heaven, not even that of angels.
