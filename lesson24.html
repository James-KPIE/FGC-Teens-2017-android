<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    Appreciation is a key to wholeness
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to be more appreciative for either small or
    big things
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    If we realise that it is by God’s grace that we are saved and we cannot
    amount to anything without Him, then we would with ease, exercise towards
    Him a grateful faith. A grateful faith keeps us in the arena of God’s
    favour. A grateful faith is desired of every child of God.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem. He passed through Samaria and Galilee
    and then He entered a certain village where ten lepers met Him. The lepers
    called out to Him and asked for His mercy. Jesus in turn asked them to go
    and show themselves to the priests according to the law (cf. Leviticus 14).
    They were on their way to the priest when they were all cleansed of their
    leprosy. One of them (a Samaritan) immediately returned to Jesus to give
    Him thanks and glorified God.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Ten Lepers Cleansed</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jesus was met by ten lepers in a certain village as he journeyed through
    Samaria and Galilee to Jerusalem. The lepers cry to him for mercy and he
    directed them to present themselves to the priests as the law for cleansing
    of lepers prescribes. They obeyed Jesus and were on their way when they
    received their miracle of cleansing. Obedience to Jesus is no doubt, key to
    the cleansing of the lepers. Let us take note of it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>One Leper Returns with thanks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Immediately one of the ten lepers received his healing, he returned to
    Jesus and with a loud voice, he glorified God. Verse 16 of our text says
    this man fell down on his face at the feet of Jesus and gave Him thanks,
    talking about gratitude from the depth of one’s heart. Jesus was honoured
    by the Samaritan’s gesture and so he asked: “Were there not ten cleansed?
    But where are the nine?” It is a good thing to be grateful and give God
    thanks in all things (1 Thes. 5:18). Giving thanks to God always is an
    expression of faith in Him. To the grateful Samaritan, Jesus said, “Arise,
    go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.” Let us learn to be thankful to
    God in all things – small or big – so we can stay whole always.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions / Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What could be the reason(s) why the other nine lepers failed to return
    to give thanks? How should we apply this to ourselves?
</p>
<p>
    2. Why is it good to give thanks to God in all things?
</p>
<p>
    3. How can we cultivate the attitude of gratitude?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    We are living in a generation when young people are said to have become
    increasingly ungrateful. Teenagers wonder what their parents have done for
    them. If they can’t have what other children are having, then their parents
    are not doing enough. They the world is all about them, they feel a sense
    of entitlement just about anything. Charitable values have given way to
    self-centredness and greed in a throwaway society. This is not the life we
    have been called into. Learning and living out the value of gratitude is
    the way of faith. This faith teaches that we are product of grace, we
    nothing in ourselves except by the grace of God (1Cor. 15:10). There is
    nothing we are or have that we have not received (1 Cor. 4:7), so we have
    every reason to be grateful to God to those He has put in care of our
    lives. We should be grateful to God in all things – be they small or big.
    God desires it so. This is the path to wholeness.
