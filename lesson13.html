</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Life is full of challenges and we do encounter challenging situations that
    put our faith to test. From our text, we read about a desperate father
    whose son is demon possessed. How do we overcome in times of impossible
    situation like this? It should be of great comfort to know that today’s
    lesson assures us that Christ can work through us even if our faith is
    struggling and incomplete. He can help our unbelief because we need
    powerful faith when faced with impossible situations. Faith is the victory
    that overcomes. <em>“</em>
    <em>
        For whatever is born of God overcomes... And this is the victory that
        has overcome the world—our faith”
    </em>
    (1 John 5:4 NKJV).
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Peter, James, and John, had just descended with Jesus from the mountain of
    transfiguration. At the base of the mountain, they reunite with the other
    nine disciples, meeting a curious crowd and a desperate father with his
    demon possessed son who was convulsing. And there was also the indicting
    scribes who mocked the disciples for their inability to heal the afflicted
    boy. Jesus stepped in to salvage the situation.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Challenge (Mark 9:14-22) </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Challenges in life are inevitable. They are situations that test a person’s
    ability or determination. Challenges put to test the depth of our trust in
God. Job 14:1 says,    <em>“Man who is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.”</em> It
    can come in different forms, shades and severity. It does not respect age,
    gender, position or wealth. In the text, all the people mentioned had
    challenges; the desperate father, the tormented boy, the faithless
    disciples and even Jesus whose authority was being questioned by the
    Scribes.
</p>
<p>
    From the text we can identify the issues:
</p>
<p>
    a. The desperate father with wavering faith (vv.17, 21-14).
</p>
<p>
    b.The demon possessed boy severely tormented by the devil (vv.17-18a,
    20-22a).
</p>
<p>
    c. The perplexed and faithless disciples and their inability to heal the
    boy (v.18b).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Panacea (Mark 9:19b-20) </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The answer or solution to intimidating and seemingly impossible situations
    lies in our faith in the Almighty God. He is the all-powerful and God of
    Impossibilities. We need faith in the all–powerful God for impossible
    situation. Jesus said to him
    <em>
        , “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes”
    </em>
    (Mark 9:23). <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    The panaceas are:
</p>
<p>
    a. Jesus is the answer. The desperate father came to Jesus (vv.17, 19b-20).
</p>
<p>
    b. Absolute dependence and trust in God (v.22).
</p>
<p>
    c. Expression of Faith (v.23, Heb. 11:6, 30-35).
</p>
<p>
    d. The Word of God; Jesus rebuked the evil spirit by the Word. (v.25, Rev.
    12:11).
</p>
<p>
    e. Effectual fervent prayer and fasting (vv.23-24, 29, James 5:16).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What is the father’s statement that shows his wavering faith? (v.22b).
    What is Jesus’ response to the man’s wavering faith? (v.23).
</p>
<p>
    2. Why couldn’t the disciples heal the boy?
</p>
<p>
    3. What should be our response to life challenges or impossible situations?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    The power of faith as demonstrated in this story should be encouraging to
    us. Impossible situations require absolute faith in the all-powerful God.
    Faith is the victory that overcomes and “all things are possible to him
    that believeth.” God’s Word is the basis of our faith. When we exercise
    strong faith in the Word of God with fervent prayers we see impossibilities
    become possible.
