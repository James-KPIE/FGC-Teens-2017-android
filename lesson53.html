    <strong>Text: </strong>
    Matthew 14:22-36
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many
    times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by
    his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the
    universe. The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact
    representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.
    After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand
    of the Majesty in heaven.” – Heb. 1:1-3
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective</strong>
    : At the end of this lesson, teens will
</p>
<p>
    appreciate Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross and thereby worship Him with all
    they are and have.

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The English word worship comes from the Old English word worship, a word
    which denotes the worthiness of the one receiving the special honour or
    devotion. This connotes actions motivated by an attitude that reveres,
    honours, or describes the worth of another person or object. In Biblical
    context worship refers to reverent devotion and service to God motivated by
    God's saving acts in history. In our text (v.32), like in the other
    Synoptic Gospels, the word worship connotes an inner attitude of adoration,
    respect, and humility spontaneously expressed in a physical manner.
    Worship, is therefore a celebration of God in His supreme worth in such a
    manner that His worthiness becomes the norm and inspiration of human
    existence. This was exactly the understanding Paul tried establish to at
    the meeting of the Areopagus in Athens (Acts 17:22-29). In spite of their
    religiosity, the Athenians were ignorant of the true God. Paul was saying
    to them that their object of worship shouldn’t be in their pantheon of
    gods, represented by statues of stone, silver and gold, but the true God,
    who is at the centre of their existence, “For in Him we live and move and
    have our being…We are His children” (Acts 17:28).<strong></strong>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Following the reports of John the Baptist’s death from his disciples, Jesus
    decided to withdraw into solitude. The ministry of Jesus was already
    gathering momentum and the crowd was seriously on his trail. They saw in
    Jesus a prophet, even more than a prophet, more like a political liberator,
    who will deliver them from Roman rule, and so they sought Him out with the
    agenda of making Him king (John 6:14-15). Although Jesus didn’t share their
    political view, He couldn’t help but to be moved with compassion, when He
    saw the mammoth crowd. Jesus healed their sick as He had always done, but
    gave them a reason to stretch their imagination, when at nightfall, instead
    of sending them away, decided to feed them with only five loaves and two
    fish. Five thousand men, apart from women and children—that was some
    number, and when they were done, there were still leftovers of 12 baskets.
    Now, more than ever before these guys were certain, this was the king they
    had been waiting for. But found a way to dismiss them (v.23), before they
    start getting any ideas.

<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Worthiness of The Son</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The public miracle of Jesus feeding the multitude was now followed by the
    one witnessed only by the disciples— He literarily walked on water, amid a
    turbulent storm, He saved Peter from sinking and then He calmed the storm.
    Wow! This was much more than they could take in. Perhaps they had thought,
    like John disciples that Jesus was going be John’s successor (reporting
    John’s death to Jesus indicated that John’s disciples assumed and
    recognised Jesus as John’s true successor) — this was way above that. They
    might have even shared the sentiments of the multitude that Jesus was a
    prophet and a liberator-king, but again, what they witnessed exceeded that.
    Jesus was more than a prophet, more than a king— when He calmed the first
    storm, they had marvelled in the interrogative, “What manner of Man is
    this?” (Matt 8:23-27) But now their clear testimony was in the affirmative,
    “Truly you are the Son of God” (v.33). It was upon this proclamation that
    they worshipped Jesus. The combined effect of Jesus’ miracle exploits
    demonstrated His authority over material things and led to a new
    appreciation of Him being more than human, and therefore worthy of worship.
    They didn’t just acknowledge His worthiness as a superman, but as Divine.
    The title the “Son of God” is a designation of His Godhood. It denotes His
    equality with the Father. To call Christ the Son of God is to assert His
    true Divinity: The second Person of the Trinity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Worship of The Son</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Having acknowledged Jesus worthiness they worshiped Him. This means worship
    in every sense of the word as highlighted in the introduction of this
    lesson. Their act of worship involved the totality of their being. First,
    it involved their intellect. They worshipped Jesus based on the knowledge
    they had of Him. This knowledge was what motivated the worth they
    attributed to Him and acknowledged Him as Deity. They weren’t just
    following a routine or observing some kind of mysterious ritual. They knew
    the object of their worship and why they were worshipping Him. Jesus said
    to the Samaritan woman, “You Samaritans worship what you do not know” (John
    4:22). This wasn’t the case for the disciples. Second, their worship
    involved their emotion. That was why it was spontaneous, it wasn’t
    mechanical, or by coercion. It was an act of delight, not of duty. The
    knowledge they had of Jesus, inspired a feeling of awe (an overwhelming
    feeling of reverence and admiration, produced by that which is grand,
    sublime or extremely powerful) and joy. That was why they expressed
    reverence and devotion towards Him in worship. There was also a physical
    aspect to their worship. They paid homage to Him, like bowing down, or
    genuflecting. This is a gestural side to worship. Those physical gestures
    were an outward expression of what they were feeling inside.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What are some the truths you’ve learnt about worshiping the Son?
</p>
<p>
    2. How would that affect your attitude to worship henceforth?
</p>
<p>
    3. What could possibly contest with the worship the Son in our lives?

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        If the disciples acknowledge and worshipped Jesus as God, because His
        exploits, we have even greater reasons, to worship Him today.
    </li>
    <li>
        Our memory verse (Heb.1:2-3) helps us to appreciate the why we have
        more reason to worship.
    </li>
    <ol start="1" type="a">
        <li>
            “By his Son, God created the world in the beginning, and it will
            all belong to the Son at the end. This Son perfectly mirrors God,
            and is stamped with God's nature.
        </li>
        <li>
            He regulates the universe by the mighty power of his command.
        </li>
        <li>
            He is the one who died to cleanse us and clear our record of all
            sin, and then sat down in highest honour beside the great God of
            heaven”
        </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
        In the early church the emphasis worship falls on the historical acts
        of the triune God motivated by infinite love, with the central focus on
        the incarnation, the cross, and exaltation of Jesus Christ the Lord,
        made real by the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:3-14; 2:18). Apostolic worship was
        a joyous experience that was informed by of glad access to God rather
        than uncertainty and dread in His presence. This understanding should
        form our pattern of worship today.
