    <strong>Text</strong>
    : Luke 18:15-17, Mark 10:16-31

<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse</strong>
    : “I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
    like a little child will never enter it." And he took the children in his
    arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.” - Mark 10:15-16
</p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line</strong>
    : Simplicity of heart like a child in faith is the key to enter the Kingdom
    of God in Heaven.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will stir up simple and practical faith in the teens.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    A toddler once saw his Grandma visibly upset and in a rage, walks up to the
    Grandma and asks, “Grandma, how are you?” You can trust this simple
    question of concern quenched the fury and rage and got everyone laughing
    including the Grandma. That is a child for you; very simple, innocent,
    humble, unpretentious and spontaneous. This is what the Lord expects from
    us to come to Him in childlike faith; trusting His goodness, care, guidance
    and provisions of a Father.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus taught two parables about prayer at the beginning of this chapter;
    the first parable on persistent prayer and the other humility in prayer.
    After these teachings, parents brought their children to Jesus “that he
    would touch them” (Luke 18:15). Jesus’ disciples rebuked the parents
    forbidding the children to come to Jesus. Jesus showed His displeasure
    (Mark 10:14) when the disciples did this. Therefore, He rebuked the
    disciples, informing them that the kingdom of God is made up of believers
    who approach Him and His kingdom with faith like a child. Jesus then “took
    them up in His arms, put His hands upon them and blessed them” (Mark
    10:16). By doing so, Jesus reaffirmed that children are very important to
Him, as well as believers with embodied faith in him like a child.    <strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>In The Eyes of Man </strong>
</p>
<p>
    How do we regard little children concerning the kingdom? They are just
    little children! They are not that important now! They have a whole lot of
    time! What do they know? How much can they understand? This attitude often
    shows in our reaction to these children in spiritual, social and family
    issue. Perhaps this was the situation of the disciples, they considered the
    children more of nuisance and unimportant therefore the effort at
    preventing these children access to Jesus. Jesus didn’t agree with that
    kind of thinking. He told the disciples, “
    <em>
        Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such
        is the kingdom of God
    </em>
    .”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>In The Eyes of God </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. God sees differently. He looks at the heart (1 Sam. 16:7, Acts
    10:34-35). When Jesus saw the behaviour of His disciples, He was greatly
    displeased. He said to them,
    <em>
        “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of
        such is the kingdom of God
    </em>
    ” (Mark 10:14).
</p>
<p>
    B. Christ has room for everyone who comes empty- handed and trusting in Him
    (Luke 18:16). He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them
    and blessed them. Those who have received Christ are called the children of
    God (Rom. 8:14-17).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>In The Kingdom of God </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Christ emphasized the need to receive the Kingdom of God as a little child.
    He acknowledged the beautiful qualities in little children; transparent,
    spontaneous, insistent and receptive to what God has freely given of which
    a believer must have to receive the kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    A. Children are highly dependent. Believers are to be dependent on the
    Lord. (Pro. 3:5-6)
</p>
<p>
    B. Children are very transparent, sincere and unpretentious.
</p>
<p>
    C. Children are creatures of faith, they can be very insistent and trust
    easily. Believers are to be people of faith, have faith in the Lord God.
</p>
<p>
    D. Children are very open and receptive. They do not have inhibitions and
    are naturally inquisitive and want to learn. Believers are to be open to
    God’s leading.
</p>
<p>
    E. Children are humble and innocent. Believers are to be humble before God
    (1 Pet. 5:5-6).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Identify ways we unintentionally restrict others access to Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
    <em>2. </em>
    Discuss ways we can practically demonstrate faith like a child<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>3. </em>
    What must people do to receive the kingdom of God? (vv.16-17) <em></em>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    Christ laid much emphasis on our becoming as little children in our faith
    to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 18:1-4). True disciples are to
    approach Christ with childlike faith; believe and follow Him without
    reservation. May the Lord stir up in us simple and childlike faith that
    trusts in His goodness, care, guidance and provisions.
