				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Life is full of ups and downs. There is no person that is free from
    challenges/needs in life. Consider the needs you have in your personal
    life, in your family, in your career or education, with respect to your
    friends in school, work or neighbourhood. The problems, heartaches,
    difficulties – how great and numerous they are! These are things we
    experience and they drive us to God in prayer. Can you imagine what makes
    possible the wonderful power after praying? “The earnest prayer of the
    righteous man makes tremendous power available – dynamic in its working.”
    God is available after praying. Consider what can be accomplished after we
    have prayed. The possibilities are limitless!

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The writer identified himself only as ‘James, a servant of God and of the
    Lord Jesus Christ” (1:1). We have great men of the Bible called James
    especially in the New Testament but this very James was believed to be the
    leader of the Church in Jerusalem (Acts 15:13) and Paul referred to him as
    “James the Lord’s brother” and in numbering him among the apostles” (Gal.
    1:19). The purpose of this book was to emphasise the importance of putting
    our faith into work which is apt and timely. There is need for us to
    demonstrate our salvation by faith in holy living and make the world know
    that faith in transforming force of this faith requires it translated into
    practical realities. Similarly, this author gave a general counsel
    concerning matters affecting the spiritual life of the Church.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer and Praise </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The earlier discussion is a revelation of the fact that sometimes problems
    and challenging situations come our way, but we should exercise
    godly/positive behaviour in the face of affliction (James 5:7-12). With
    this background, in trial, the Christian’s highest duty and his greatest
    privilege is communion with God. This is the picture James is trying to
    paint. Is there any among you afflicted? He should pray (v.13a). Someone
    says “prayer is the bridge between panic and peace.” The line to heaven is
    always open. We are always to pray! Not only are we to pray, but we are to
    sing as well. We should remember God in life’s happy moment – He says, ‘Is
    any merry? Let him sing psalms’ (v.13b). Praise should fill our lips when
    life is joyful and there should be praise even under pressure when we
    remember the goodness of God (Eph. 5:18-20).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer and Faith for Healing </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Affliction comes in different forms and one of it is illness or sickness.
    Prayer and faith for healing are seen in three dimensions in the above
    verses:
</p>
<p>
    The Privilege of Divine Healing (5:14-15a): We are enjoined to pray in
    times of illness. This serves dual purposes – it is our duty and our
    privilege in Christ. “Healing is children’s meat.” In the time of illness,
    elders are given the assignment of praying and anointing the sick, which
    must be done in faith believing the Lord to raise the sick up. It is
    noteworthy here that it is not the anointing oil that will work out the
    healing but the Lord through the prayer of faith offered for the sick by
    the elders. The prayer of faith has the promise of an answer.
</p>
<p>
    Healing and Forgiveness (5:15b-16a): However, is sin the cause of all
    illnesses and sicknesses? (John 9:1-2). Sin can cause some specific
    sickness (John 5:14). Here is a promise of healing for the sick and
    forgiveness for the repentant. The admonition, “confess your sins to one
    another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed” (v.16a) is
    essential, is needful so that we might receive help for our trouble.
</p>
<p>
    Effective Prayer (5:16b-18): The synonym for effectual are: capable,
    effective, efficacy, capability, efficacious etc. What is effective prayer?
    It is the prayer that comes from a righteous man (16b). A man whose heart
    is perfect before God! A man who is in right relationship with God and man.
    Do we have men whose prayer were effective? Yes! We have examples of such
    like Elijah – he was a man of like nature with ourselves (1 Kings 17:1,
    18:1, 42-45). He was a man exactly like you and I, having the same
    opportunity and resources available from God that are available to us. Any
    true child of God must be ready to pray the prayer of faith that will bring
    healing. Elijah’s prayer for rain assures us that God answers prayer in the
    natural realm. Prayer not only changes us, but through it God also changes
    things.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What makes prayers powerful? (James 5:16).
</p>
<p>
    2. What can make prayers powerless and be denied? (James 1:5-8
</p>
<p>
    3. How can we escape double mindedness? (Jos. 1:8, 2 Cor. 10:5).

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    In this lesson, we see prayer plus praise plus faith equals wonders (prayer
    + praise + faith = wonders). You cannot disconnect one from the other.
    Prayers that does not doubt wins the deal. We are told to pray in the time
    of trouble! We are to make joyful sound in the time of ease! And we are to
    pray the prayer of faith to heal the sick. All these done in the
    righteousness of God. “When we worry, we work, but when we pray, God w
