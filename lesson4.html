    <strong>Text</strong>
    <strong>:</strong>
    John 1:29-34; I Cor.12:12-13,19-20,25,27; Eph.4:4-6.
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is
    more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize
    you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” - Matthew 3:11.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    We are baptized into one Spirit so that we can live in unity with one
    another.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    At the end of this lesson, the student will have a deeper knowledge of
    getting baptized as Jesus requires us to do.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    John the Baptist baptized with water, but he foretold that One was coming
    who would baptize with the Holy Spirit. John the Baptist called Jesus “the
    Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” He also testified that
    Jesus was the Son of God. John the Baptist said that he came baptizing with
    water so that Jesus “might be revealed to Israel.” Jesus would indeed
    baptize all believers with the gift of the Holy Spirit. There must have
    been some very good reasons for Him to do so. What were the reasons?
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    (Matt.3:11; Jn. 1:29-34). John gave this testimony: I saw the Spirit come
    down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. I would not have known Him,
    except that the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on
    whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with
    the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.”

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>One Spirit Baptizes us into One Body </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its
    parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. For we were all
    baptized by one Spirit into one body whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free
    and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Now you are the body of
    Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>We Must be United </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Paul wrote to the Ephesian believers on "one baptism," to remind them that,
    regardless of their background or nationality, they all served the same
    Lord, shared the same faith, and had experienced the same baptism. It is
    possible he was referring to water baptism; i.e. all believers have the
    same testimony of salvation and have been baptized in the name of the
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He could also be referring to Spirit baptism;
    i.e. all believers have been placed into the Body of Christ through the
    Spirit’s power. Either way, the emphasis is on unity among Christians.
    Verse 3 of Ephesians 4 says, "Make every effort to keep the unity of the
    Spirit through the bond of peace." The Holy Spirit works to unify believers
    and provides assurance that they are children of God (Rom. 8:16; Eph.
    1:13-14). By reminding the church that they all had a similar testimony and
    that they were all partakers in the same Holy Spirit, Paul encouraged them
    to work together for the cause of Christ so that the message of redemption
    would continue to spread throughout the world according to Matthew 28:19.

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. John the Baptist said that Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit. Why
    would He?
</p>
<p>
    2. What does it mean that we would get baptized with the Holy Spirit? Will
    it hurt?
</p>
<p>
    3. What reason would Jesus have to baptize us all with the same Holy
    Spirit?

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    What to Emphasize and Talk About:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit and Baptism</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “
    <em>
        I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming
        after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He
        will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire”
    </em>
    (Matthew 3:11).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    We are baptized into one Spirit so that we can live in unity with one
    another.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>Today’s Bible story in summary:</strong>
    Jesus baptizes all believers with one Spirit (the Holy Spirit) into one
    body (the body of Christ.) As believers we are integral parts of the body,
    and as such we must have equal concern for one another. We are given one
    Spirit so that we can live in unity and care for one another, and
    ultimately be enabled to do the work that Christ has for us to do!
