			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>

					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>

<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    At the end of this lesson, teens would be able to determine to be who God

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The sinful nature which man inherited from Adam (and Eve) is rebellious,
    stubborn, irrational, and boastful. When we come to Christ however, the
    Holy Spirit comes to live in us. As we allow His move and control over our
    lives, He enables us to obey God, and obey our parents; live disciplined
    and impactful lives, and thus live daily as great vessels of honour:
</p>
<p>
    1. A source of blessing to our generation and
</p>
<p>
    2. An instrument of praise to God.
</p>
<p>
    The story of Naaman’s Jewish maid whose kind effort led to the cure of the
    Syrian general’s leprosy remains a great inspiration to us. Have you read
    that story? It is found in 2 Kings 5. She was a vessel of honour, even in a
    foreign land. She was an ambassador of Yahweh. What kind of impact, on your
    fellow mankind – right from home to school, the Church and in fact,
    everywhere else?
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Bible enlightens us of the immense benefit of the Holy Spirit in the
    life of a child of God. When our lives are spirit-filled, we don’t struggle
    with the will of God. A clear manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit in
    our lives becomes undeniable. The life of a Spirit is filled child is
    characterized thus: loves unconditionally; ever joyful and full of peace;
    not easily provoked or taking vengeance, ever gentle and full of goodness;
    it is a life of total faith in God trusting Him for all, no matter what; it
    is meek (submissive, cooperative) and full of temperance (self-control)
    (Gal. 5:22).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit Filled Child Obeys Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A major characteristic of a Spirit-filled person is obedience—obedience to
    the leading of the Spirit, obedience to legitimate authority. As teenagers
    and co-labourers with God in building God’s church and growing the Kingdom
    through evangelism, we are called to a life of loyalty and obedience to
    leadership, as opposed to rebellion. We should be submissive and
    cooperative, so that our impact and relevance to the work is effective and
    productive. This is why we must be filled with the Holy Spirit. Our loyalty
    will earn us the listening ears of our leaders and so our suggestions,
    lofty desires and aspirations will be highly esteemed and incorporated into
    the large plan of the church for growth in all dimensions to the glory of
    God. It is required of us to steadily pray for our leaders; it is required
    of us to share the work with our leaders, making ourselves available to
    serve at whatever capacity. As we do these, God promotes us from level to
    level and causes us to be celebrated before men.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit Filled Child Honours Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As we have noted in both our introduction and insight, when we are filled
    with the Holy Spirit, our obedience to God comes with willingness.
    Honouring our parents (and in fact elders and teachers) is obedience to
    God’s command, and it brings us honour before God. As we already know,
    honouring our parents is a secret to living a long rewarding life. When we
    submit fully to the Spirit of God who lives in us, we allow Him to work out
    in us such wonderful and gracious virtues that stand us out as
    well-brought-up children to the praise and glory of God who has called us
    and made us a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation and a
    peculiar (special) people (1 Pet. 2:9).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What is our proof of infilling with the Holy Spirit?
</p>
<p>
    2. How does being filled with the Spirit profit us?
</p>
<p>
    3. In what ways can teens make themselves sufficiently relevant to God’s
    work in the Church?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Disrespect to authority, especially by young people is a growing concern
    in our society today. There is serious concern on how children and
    adolescents treat their parents and elders. This is a sign that we are in
    the last days (2 Tim. 3:2). The spirit of the last days is at work.
    However, a Spirit-life can’t be overcome by this spirit.
</p>
<p>
    2. The hallmark of a Spirit-filled life is obedience—obedience to God and
    to legitimate authority. Church leadership and parents are major legitimate
    authorities in the life of a Spirit-filled teenager.
</p>
<p>
    3. When we submit fully to the Spirit of God who lives in us, we allow Him
    to work out in us such wonderful and gracious virtues that stand us out as
    well-brought-up children to the praise and glory of God.
