</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Have you ever been scolded, punished or ridiculed for doing or wanting to
    do the right thing? Have you suffered any unfairness or disadvantage from
    people, just because you wouldn’t do the wrong thing or because you chose
    to be positively different? How did you feel? Terrible, unappreciated,
    wronged, mistreated, victimised, persecuted… it is possible words may not
    be sufficient to capture how you felt. Perhaps you would be able to relate
    with the ordeal of Peter and John in our text, when they were seized and
    locked away for being the nice guys.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Peter and John were arrested and thrown into jail for preaching in the
    temple about Jesus Christ. This was after God had used them to heal the
    lame beggar at the beautiful gate. The crowd who saw the miracle happen had
    become Peter and John’s congregation and this didn’t go down well with the
    religious rulers. They didn’t want the apostles to preach to the people
    about Jesus, especially about the fact that he resurrected having been
    crucified. So, they got them locked up and tried to intimidate them. Peter
    and John, however, wouldn’t be intimidated, they boldly replied their
    captors: "Whether it's right in God's eyes to listen to you rather than to
    God, you decide. As for us, there's no question — we can't keep quiet about
    what we've seen and heard" (Acts 4:19-20 MSG). Since the religious
    authorities, couldn’t find any reason to punish the disciples, they had to
    let them go—but not without some more threats. However, it appeared the
    authorities’ threats didn’t do much in wearing out the courage of the
    apostles. Let’s find out why?

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Courage in Company</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After their release, Peter and John headed back to their friends and fellow
    believers to let them in on what had happened. It felt good to be in good
    company and to unburden their trouble. They were not alone in this. Being
    in the company of their friends, who shared their sufferings boosted their
    courage to hold on to their conviction. A friend in need is a friend
    indeed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Courage in Prayer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just about the company. It was also that they knew the right
    thing to do when there was trouble. They prayed. They prayed together. They
    prayed aright. They didn’t go into a panicky frenzy at the threats of the
    authorities. They were motivated to pray by their trust in God. They
    acknowledged that God was greater than the difficulty they were faced with.
    They took confidence in the fact the God who created the heavens and the
    earth was their God. He can take charge of the challenge in their life.
    Their courage was bolstered by the word of God and by the testimonies of
    those who had walked the journey of faith before them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Courage in Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In their prayers, they weren’t bothered about self-preservation or the
    destruction of their enemies. They saw the threats of the authorities as
    being against God’s purpose for which they lived— the spread of the Gospel
    of Jesus Christ. This was the purpose that motivated them to pray. For this
    same cause, Herod, Pilate, the power of Rome and of the Jews put together
    had tried to stop Jesus, but they failed. In the face of threats, they
    prayed for boldness to be committed to the purpose of God for their lives—
    preaching the Gospel. No power could scare away the purpose of God in and
    for their lives. It wasn’t just about them, it was about purpose!
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>Courage in Power</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As they brought their prayers to a close, they prayed for the miraculous to
    happen in their ministry of the Word. This line of prayer is indicative in
    of their faith in the supernatural workings of God. As they participated in
    God’s purpose, they also wanted to experience God’s power being manifest
    through them. For sure, when the power of God becomes apparent in and
    through their lives, just as it happened in the case of Peter and John in
    the healing of the lame beggar, they couldn’t be bothered about the
    hostilities of the authorities.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What can we learn from the way the apostles responded to the threats in
    their lives?
</p>
<p>
    2. What is the significance of building a strong peer-faith culture in
    facing life challenges?
</p>
<p>
    3. Can you identify the connection between God’s purpose for your life and
    the challenges or threats you are facing?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    The fact that we are identified as children of God and followers of Christ,
    targets us for challenges that would want to shake the very core of our
    conviction. However, in the place of prayer (not motivated by fear,
    vengefulness, or despair but by absolute trust in God), and in the company
    of our God-given friends, we must take courage in the purpose for which we
    have been called and the power of God to back this purpose and to preserve
    us in Christ for the hope of our calling (Read Heb. 3:6).
