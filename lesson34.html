			<h2>Lesson 34</h2><h2>Saved By Grace</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Acts 15:1-12
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this not from
    yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can
    boast.” - Ephesians 2:8, 9
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    We can only be saved by grace alone.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    At the end of this lesson, teens should
</p>
<p>
    understand that works and activities do not save but we can only be saved
    by grace.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The love of God for humanity resulted in the redemptive act and processes
    by Jesus Christ paying the wages of our sin on the cross of Calvary. By His
    precious blood He made atonement for our sin and purchased for us an
    eternal inheritance. We now have free access to boldly enter God’s throne
    room (Heb. 4:16). We are saved by grace through faith. Grace is defined as
    unmerited favour: A free gift of God’s love. Faith is believing and
    trusting from the heart. That means, if we can believe God and His
    redemptive plan through Jesus, we have access to His free gift of grace,
    “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
    God, even to them that believe on his name” (John 1:12).

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and insisted that circumcision was
    essential for justification. Perhaps they based their theology on such
    passages as Gen. 17:14 and Exo. 12:48-49. However, they were sure to cause
    a severe division in the church, so their teaching brought Paul and
    Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. The church at Antioch
    felt it was wise to discuss the matter with the apostles and elders in
    Jerusalem. So they commissioned Paul and Barnabas for the task and wisely
    sent some other believers along as witnesses. These witnesses would protect
    Paul and Barnabas against being accused of distorting the facts.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Contention with Gentile Believers</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The fanatical Jews must have imagined that for a non-Jew to become a
    worshipper of God, he must first convert to Judaism. They must have
    imagined that to be a Christian, one had to first become a Jew, or at least
    surrender one’s own culture and identity, and adopt the lifestyle of an
    Israelite. These Jewish believers travelled to the Gentile churches,
    teaching that, "Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye
    cannot be saved (Acts 15:1). There was serious debate between these Jewish
    believers with Paul and Barnabas. The believers in Antioch did not agree
    with these Jewish teachers believing they were not sent by the apostles,
    and their teaching did not represent the official position of the Jerusalem
    congregation. They decided to send a delegation, led by Paul and Barnabas,
    to bring this issue to the apostles at Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Church Elders Rule on Gentile Believers </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The apostles and elders at Jerusalem met to consider this question with
    many other believers in attendance. The problem was no small one. The
    presentation of Apostle Peter channelled a good course for balanced
    judgment with his submission, “Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a
    yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were
    able to bear?” (Acts 15:10). After much discussion, Apostle James gave the
    verdict, “Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
    among the Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that
    they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from
    things strangled, and from blood” (Acts 15:19-20).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Salvation is for Everyone Who Believes </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our memory verse, Ephesians 2:8-9, gives a clear picture of the will and
    mind of God concerning salvation. It is by grace through faith. Romans
    chapter 10:8-10 explains how we can be saved. Romans 10:12-13 gives the
    conclusion, “For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
    the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever
    shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What was the contention of the fanatical Jews?
</p>
<p>
    2. What do you understand by the concept “Saved by Grace”?
</p>
<p>
    3. What are some church traditions that undermine the concept of “Saved by
    Grace” today?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Some Jewish believers contended that for a non-Jew to become a
    worshipper of God, he must first convert to Judaism. They believed that to
    be a Christian, one has to first become a Jew, or at least surrender one’s
    own culture and identity, and adopt the lifestyle of an Israelite. They
    argued that Gentile Christians should be circumcised (Acts 15:1).
</p>
<p>
    2. There are so many such conditions we witness in the body of Christ
    today. Some strange doctrines have been introduced. That is why the
    scripture warns us, “Be not carried about with divers and strange
    doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace;
    not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied
    therein” (Heb. 13:9).
</p>
<p>
    3. We must watch out against teachings that emphasize forms and traditions,
    self-help tips and human-efforts over the truth of God’s word about our
    salvation. Let’s not be like the Galatians, who having received the Gospel
    by the Spirit, allowed themselves to be swept of by the dogma of rules
    taught by men(Gal. 3:1-3).
