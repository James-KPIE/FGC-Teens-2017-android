				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The institution of the family (a man, woman, and their children) is not
    merely an invention of the society, but an institution founded by God
    himself. It is God’s agency for populating the earth with a godly
    generation (Mal. 2:15). The family is formed exclusively through a loving
    lifelong marriage covenant between a man and a woman. The traditional
    family was once the core foundation and stabilizing force of the society.
    However, the family has become so fragmented that it is difficult to
    describe a normal family in a society that is lapsing into degeneracy. With
    the high rate of divorce, children being born out of wedlock, homosexual
    marriages, sexual relationships outside of marriage becoming the norm, and
    other sexual and marital distortions, the family is being redefined by
    those who think little or nothing of the integrity of the institution.
    There are no scruples. Certainly, in a society where there are no
    boundaries, the definition of morality becomes relative—depending on what
    fits the situation. Sadly, Christian families are being soiled and mired in
    this moral erosion. There is increasing concern about the lack of spiritual
    focus in the homes of many Christians. Family altars and Bible studies have
    given way to addictive television viewing, entertainment, and other
    activities that threaten the home. This shift has had a distressing impact
    on the collective values of today’s Christian family. Nevertheless, the
    foundation of God stands sure, the Bible remains the manual for the
    principles that holds the family together.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Right from Eden God set the paradigm for the family. The family was
    supposed to take after the Godhead, God Himself being a family as
    manifested in the Trinity and in His capacity as the Creator, being the
    Father of all creation (Eph. 3:14-15). Subsequent to the fall, sin led to
    the distortion of this divine institution. The family became a showground
    for the struggle between husbands, wives and children. While husbands
    resort to dominating their wives, wives contrive in manipulating their
    husbands. Parents mistreat or undermine their children, while the children
    disobey and dishonour their parents. Alluding to foundational Old Testament
    texts in Matthew 19:6, Jesus asserted the unity that should characterize
    the family, making it clear, that whatever anomalies that may have altered
    the family institution, was never part of God’s original intention (Matt.
    19:8). Paul’s treatment of the issue of the family in our text must be
    studied in the entire context of the letter to the Ephesians. Marriage is
    set in the larger context of the restoration of all things and the unity of
    the body of Christ (the Church) under the headship of Christ. Christ’s
    relationship with the Church, provides the pattern for Christian marriage
    and by implication, Christian family. Therefore, the Spirit of Christ must
    influence all family relationships (v. 18). Family members who are
    Spirit-filled will invariably uphold and adhere to God’s principles for the
    family.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Principle of Authority</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Family members must acknowledge that God is the Source of all authority. He
    has all power and all authority, and He entrusts roles of leadership to
    individuals in the family. All the family members are persons equal in
    dignity. However, family members must subscribe to the lines of authority
    God has set in the family. First, the orderliness in structures of
    authority reflects the order of God’s own nature. God is a Trinity: the
    Father, the Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Each member of the
    Trinity works within the structure of authority and fulfils a specific
    role, perfectly complementing the others and demonstrating God’s glory.
    Second, God outlines authority structures that provide direction and
    functionality for the family. The principle of authority, requires that
    since God placed authorities over us, to obey them is to submit to God’s
    design and authority in our lives. Authority comes with responsibility,
    both for the one who exercises authority and the one who is under
    authority. God assigns husbands with the responsibility of the leadership
    of the family unit. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the
    Church. The metaphor of giving up oneself for another as Christ did,
    indicates the extreme devotion and selflessness with which the husband must
    understand, care for, protect and provide for the needs (domestic and
    spiritual) of the wife—and of course the family. In serving the needs of
    the family, the husband must put aside his own interests. A wife is to
    submit to the leadership of her husband, with respect, meekness and as a
    helper, homemaker and a faithful collaborator in building a godly home.
    Parents are responsible to teach their children the truth of God’s word,
    train them in basic life skills, and discipline them in love, when their
    heart stray in folly; and children are to honour and obey their parents.
    The injunction to honour one’s parents entails respect for both father and
    mother. The injunction has no limitation or termination, that is, no one
    outgrows honouring one’s parents. It is also noteworthy that the injunction
    comes with divine blessings and long life (6:3).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Principle of Accountability</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Family members must acknowledge that everyone is accountable to God in
    carrying out their responsibilities in the family. Each person is
    accountable to God for his or her actions, whether he is in authority over
    others or in a position under authority. Authority figures are accountable
    for how they exercise their authority. Those under authority are also
    accountable to God for their responses to authority. In view of this truth,
    it behoves family members to be accountable to one another, in dispensing
    their roles and responsibilities in the family. For, in being accountable
    to one another they are being accountable to God. Family members cannot
    think that the observance of their responsibilities is conditional to the
    response of the others. In other words, the husband should not think that
    his obligation to love his wife should be in reciprocity to his wife
    showing him respect and vice versa. Children cannot chose to respect their
    parents, contingent upon whether or not they are deserving of respect, just
    as parents cannot deny the child of care and nurture, because of
    misbehaviour. Family members must realize that the recompense of obedience
    or otherwise of this principle is with God and not with their human wardens
    or wards.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Principle of Amity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Family relationships must be built on the platform of mutual affection and
    goodwill for one another. Affection and goodwill are the outgrowth of love,
    motivated by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5). When love is at the centre of
    family relationships, we would treat one another with respect and
    understanding and we would appreciate one another’s uniqueness. Love
    motivates us to be conciliatory in accommodating one another’s shortcomings
    and in building support systems that will grow and solidify our family
    relationships. That is love motivated by the Spirit in us in not a
    sentimental love, rather it is volitional, because it derives from the same
    love with which Christ loves us. Christ loves us ‘in spite of’ not ‘because
    of’. Christ chose to love us irrespective of our foibles, family
relationships must be based on love without preconditions.    <strong></strong>

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. How significant are the principles discussed in this study to your role
    or responsibility in your family?
</p>
<p>
    2. Read Acts 4:19 and Colossians 3:23-24, how should we respond under an
    authority that asks us to do something that is wrong?
</p>
<p>
    3. What kind of parent would like to be and what kind of disposition would
    expect your children to have towards you, when become a parent?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    The disinclination of children obey or honour their parents has always been
    a matter of concern, ever since Paul’s days. He warned Timothy, “For men
will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revellers,    <strong>disobedient to parents</strong>, ungrateful, unholy…” (2 Tim. 3:2).
    Peter also corroborates Paul’s teaching when he warned about God’s anger
    against self-willed renegades who will disregard authority, thus refusing
    to give honour to those whom it is due (2 Pet. 2:10). In the face of the
    rising tide of relativism, it is almost becoming cheesy to talk about
    obeying parents. Children are unnecessarily indulged or left on their own,
    with little or no parental authority or influence over their lives. This is
    a major part of the dysfunctionality that has impaired the family
    institution. However, popular culture does not change the standards of God.
    As a teenager planted in a family, it is significant that you stand out in
    upholding and modelling Biblical principles in your relationship with your
    parents or wardens.
