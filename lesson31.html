				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus came to redeem humanity by paying the wages of our sins through His
    death on the cross, “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
    which was lost (Luke 19:10). The Gospel of Luke gives an insight into the
    earthly ministry of Jesus, “…, of all that Jesus began both to do and
    teach” (Acts 1:1), and what happened after His departure, “…commanded them
    that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the
    Father...” They needed power of the Holy Spirit to evangelize the world.
    “For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
    Ghost not many days hence… But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
    Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
    Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
    of the earth” (Acts 1:2-8). This promise was fulfilled on the day of
    Pentecost. The Great Commission began on that day. The first Gospel message
    by Apostle Peter resulted in about three thousand converts. Then God opened
    the door of salvation to the Gentiles also, “And as I began to speak, the
    Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning” (Acts 11:15). The
    scripture also declares, “For the promise is unto you, and to your
    children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God
    shall call” (Acts 2:39). We are all called to preach the Gospel to the
    whole world (Matt. 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-16).
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Book of Acts gives a narrative insight into the spread of the Gospel.
    In Acts chapter two, the Holy Spirit fell on about one hundred and twenty
    disciples who gathered together in the Upper Room on the ‘Day of
    Pentecost’. In chapter ten, the gift of the Holy Spirit was also given to
    the Gentiles who gathered in the house of Cornelius during the preaching of
    Peter. One important thing to note was the conclusion of Apostle Peter,
    “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth I perceive that God is
    no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and
    worketh righteousness, is accepted with him (Acts 10:34-35). The
    implication is that, the ‘Gospel Message’ is for the whole world (Acts
    1:8).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Prayer of Cornelius </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cornelius was in a fasting and praying session in his house when he had a
    vision of angelic visitation. Cornelius was a centurion, a Roman officer in
    charge of 100 soldiers, in the Italian Regiment, consisting of 600
    soldiers. In the New Testament, centurions are consistently viewed in a
    favourable light (Matt 8:5-10; Mark 15:44-45; Acts 22:25-26). Centurion
    Cornelius became one of the first Gentiles after Pentecost to hear the good
    news of Jesus Christ's forgiveness. Cornelius was described as devout and
    God-fearing which might have accounted for such divine attention.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Vision of Peter </strong>
</p>
<p>
    While Apostle Peter was praying, he fell into a trance in which God gave
    him a vision of a sheet coming down to earth with all kinds
    of...animals...reptiles...and birds. When God commanded him to kill and eat
    these animals, Peter declined. He knew from the Law that he should not eat
    unclean animals (Lev. 11). His intentions were good, but he was being
    disobedient. The Jews considered all but themselves unclean. To remove this
    prejudice, the vision significantly taught that God had cleansed all (Jews
    and Gentiles) who are faithful to Him.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Gentiles Receive The Gift Of The Holy Spirit.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In bringing salvation to the Gentiles, God had to prepare Peter to bring
    the message and Cornelius to hear the message. Salvation is a divine work
    of grace, but God works through human channels. It is interesting to see
    how religious a person can be and still not be saved. Certainly, Cornelius
    was sincere in his obedience to God's Law, his fasting, and his generosity
    to the Jewish people. In every way, he was a model of religious
    respectability - and yet he was not a saved man. Apostle Peter had to go
    and preach to him and his people. It is our responsibility to preach the
    Gospel message to sinners.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Apostle Peter said, “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of
    persons…” What do you understand by this statement?
</p>
<p>
    2. Cornelius and his people received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. What
    is the significance of Holy Spirit baptism in evangelism?
</p>
<p>
    3. The Gospel message is for the whole world, discuss your own role.

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. The statement of Apostle Peter “...of a truth I perceive that God is no
    respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
    righteousness, is accepted with him” (Acts 10:34-35), is fundamental and
    key note in Christianity.
</p>
<p>
    2. The Gospel message of salvation is open to ALL who surrender to the
    Lordship of Jesus Christ (John 1:12). The scripture declares, “For
    whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (Rom 10:13).
</p>
<p>
    3. The commandment of the Master referred to as The Great Commission
    demands, “…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
    creature” (Mark 16:15). The Gospel of Matthew says, “Go ye therefore, and
    teach all nations…” (Matt 28:19).
</p>
<p>
    4. The Holy Spirit does not discriminate as to who should receive the
    Gospel. We shouldn’t also be discriminatory to those we have tagged
    “unlikely people”, in our minds— area boys, prostitutes, drug addicts,
    petty thieves, yahoo boys etc.
