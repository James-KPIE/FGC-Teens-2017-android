			<h2>Lesson 11</h2><h2>The Holy Spirit Lives In Us</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text</strong>
    : 1 Cor. 6:17-20
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse</strong>
    : “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in
    you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own” - 1 Corinthians
    6:19
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    The Holy Spirit is significant to the process
</p>
<p>
    of building a character of Christ-likeness
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to understand their roles connect with the
role of the Holy Spirit in developing a Christ like character    <strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    When your friend or loved one says to you, “you are in my thoughts”, it
    obviously doesn’t mean you are physically occupying the person’s thoughts.
    It rather means you are pleasantly thought of by the person. The use of the
    preposition ‘in’ is a figure of speech simply describing a relationship of
    fondness. This is the same idea that describes what it means for the Holy
    Spirit to live in us.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>When our text says “the Holy Spirit lives in you” (v.19), it doesn’t mean
    he is physically located inside of our physical bodies. It is a figure of
    speech that describes a personal relationship rather than a physical
    location. The Holy Spirit is an infinite being and can’t be contained in a
finite being- like a genie trapped in a bottle like the one in the    <em>Aladdin s</em>tory in the <em>Arabian Nights.</em> The Holy Spirit is
    omnipresent, meaning he has his presence everywhere at the same time.
    Deeper than the relationship of fondness we have with our friends or loved
    ones, when we become born again, the Holy Spirit enters into a special,
    intimate, personal relationship with us. This special relationship comes
    with privileges as well as responsibilities.</strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Privileges of The Indwelling of The Spirit </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit testifies to our adoption</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When we become born again, we are adopted as children (sons and daughters)
    into the family of God. We become united with God (v.17) and the Holy
    Spirit testifies to that special relationship we have with the father (Gal.
    4:6). The Holy Spirit agrees with our spirit to affirm (guarantee) that we
    are God’s children (Rom. 8:16). That way we are not in doubt about our
    status with God. This gives us the confidence to facilitate our
    relationship with God. We don’t feel inhibited, intimidated or inferior
    before God. We enjoy the benefit of the access and intimacy we have with
    the Father, to ask him whatever we need and to take possession of our
    inheritance in God – the inheritance we share with Christ. Moreover, part
    of what makes us children of God, is that we are led (influenced, directed)
    by the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:14).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit guarantees our inheritance</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The same way the Holy Spirit guarantees our adoption into the family of
    God, he also guarantees the inheritance we share with Christ. In other
    words, the Holy Spirit is guarantor of our eternal destiny with Christ.
    Ephesians 1:13-14 assures us that the Holy Spirit is given to us as a seal
    of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of
    Christ’s glory. At the point of salvation, we receive the Spirit of
    promise, preserving us till the final attainment of our eternal destiny.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit is God’s mark of ownership on us</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This further shows that the Holy Spirit is God’s seal of ownership on us.
    The seal of the Spirit is the mark that we truly belong to God. In our
    text, we are reminded, that we do not belong to ourselves, we have been
    bought with a price. We are God’s priceless possession. The cost – the
    blood of Jesus – his only begotten Son. This means that God greatly values
    us, motivated by the unconditional love he has for us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit fills our hearts with love</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Romans 5:5 tell us, “For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has
    given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.” Because we are
    a product of his incomparable love, we have also been wired to love. The
    Holy Spirit in us pumps out virtues of love— joy, peace, patience,
    kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Gal.
    5:22-23). As these characters are formed in us Christ is formed in us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>E. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit conforms us to be like Christ</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Bible says, “As the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more
    and more like him and reflect his glory even more” (2 Cor. 3:18 NLT). This
    process of changing us to be more like Jesus is called sanctification. The
    Holy Spirit is the One that facilitates this process. You cannot reproduce
    the character of Jesus on your own strength. Rick Warren said,
    “Christ-likeness is not produced by imitation, but by inhabitation.” It is
    the Spirit of Christ in us that transforms us to the image of the Son, as
    this aligns with God’s ultimate purpose for us (Rom. 8:29).
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Responsibilities of The Indwelling of The Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Complete obedience to the dictates of the Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    First, because we are God’s children we are led (directed, instructed,
    carried along) by the Holy Spirit. This implies that we do the bidding of
    the Holy Spirit as he directs us to do God’s will. We are no more obligated
    to be controlled by our canal faculties – the flesh. The flesh does not
    refer to our body, but our selfish instinct to do as we please in
    disobedience to God’s will. This cannot happen anymore since we do not own
    ourselves – we belong to God. We can’t do as we please. Our status as
    children of God demands that we obey the dictates of the Spirit. As we make
    choices in consonance with the Spirit’s directives, we bring honor to God.
    One vital way to honor God, especially with our bodies, is to steer clear
    of every sexual experimentation that defiles us (v.20).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>
        Concerted and Consistent growth in relationship with Christ
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Second, to become more like Christ, we must deliberately take
    responsibility for growing our relationship with Christ. We already have
    the benefit of being adopted as children, but it doesn’t just end there. We
    take the relationship further and deeper, as we keep in step with the Holy
    Spirit and allow him to transform our minds (Rom. 12:2). This way we are
    being transformed into Christ’s likeness by his Spirit. Paul gives us an
    insight of how this work when he wrote in Phil. 2:12, “…Work hard to show
    the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear.”

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Can you recap in your own words what it means that the Holy Spirit lives
    in us?
</p>
<p>
    2. Which of the privileges we enjoy as a result of the Spirit indwelling in
    us strikes you the most and why?
</p>
<p>
    3. Why is it important that the special relationship we have with the Holy
    Spirit should come with responsibilities?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    Today we have learnt a number things about what it means for the Holy
    Spirit to live in us. Although, what we discussed is not exhaustive, the
    truth we have been exposed to is enough to help us take advantage of the
    deposits of the Spirit in us to become more like Christ. Never forget,
    “…God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what
    pleases him” (Phil. 2:13).
