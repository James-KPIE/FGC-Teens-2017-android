</p>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    A fruit is a product of the tree from which it is plucked, the tree is the
    product of the seed from which it springs. This statement underpins what we
    would be learning today.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Paul the Apostle emphasized the importance of a life that is lived in the
    fullness of Christ through the influence of the Holy Spirit. If we live in
    the Spirit, we should also walk in the Spirit. Paul contrasted the life
    that is lived in the flesh (Gal.5:19-21) with the life lived in the Spirit.
    Paul’s point is that the more a believer yields to the Spirit, the less he
    succumbs to the acts of sinful nature—the flesh. The more she yields to the
    Spirit, the she bears the fruit of the Spirit.<strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Character of The Fruit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jesus said, “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good
    fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit…” (Luke 6:43-44a). A fruit
    is a product of the tree from which it is plucked, the tree is the product
    of the seed from which it springs. Peter said, we are born again, not of
    corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and enduring
    word of God (1 Pet. 1:23). John wrote that no one who is born of God will
    continue to sin, because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on
    sinning, because they have been born of God (1John 3:9). Paul in our text
    tags along same line of the allusion of Jesus, Peter and John to the
    imageries of the seed, tree and fruit, when he used the metaphor of the
    fruit to illustrate the disposition of a life that is filled or influenced
    by the Holy Spirit (vv.22-23). The fruit of the Spirit refers therefore to
    the character or nature of the person who is born of the Spirit and led by
    the Spirit. In other words, to have the fruit of the Spirit, is to have the
    character (nature, quality, disposition, personality) of the Holy Spirit.
    The fruit of the Spirit derives from the life of Christ. That is the life
    we received, when we got born again. The seed of Christ was planted in us
    at new birth. The Holy Spirit is the facilitating agent of the new birth
    experience (Titus 3:5). The fruit of the Spirit is therefore the fruit
    (character, nature) of Christ.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Characteristics of The Fruit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Paul goes on to highlight the characteristics that depict the fruit of the
    Spirit. What it simply means is that anyone with the character of the
    Spirit, will manifest certain characteristics peculiar to the personality
    of the Holy Spirit, invariably the personality of Christ. This
    characteristics (nine in number) are virtues that are cultivated by the
    Holy Spirit in the one who is born of and led by the Spirit. After all,
    “…that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (John 3:6b). Let’s
    examine these virtues:
</p>
<p>
    A. Love: The word used for love in the text depicts God's love and also of
    genuine Christian love, which reflects and acts in accordance with God's
    love (e.g.1 John 4:7-8).It has been described as an intense desire to
    please God and to do good to mankind. A Christian should show love toward
    others and seek their highest good, no matter who or what, just as God does
    (Matt. 5:43-48). 1 John 3:18 says we are to love in deed and in truth and
    not in word nor tongue. ‘Love’ is listed first because Paul rates it to be
    the most important of the virtues (1 Co 13:13) and because all of the
    others may be understood to derive from it.
</p>
<p>
    B. Joy: Joy is a distinctive of a life that is born of the Spirit. True joy
    comes with the believer's salvation and assurance of an eternal destiny. It
    is the cheerful disposition of a regenerated soul. Like every other virtue
    in the list, joy is a quality and not a feeling. It is therefore not
    determined by surrounding situations—pleasant or unpleasant. The joy of the
    Lord is what givesthe believer the surge of strength in his daily walk with
    God (Neh. 8:10).
</p>
<p>
    C. Peace: This is the calm, quiet, and order, which takes place in a
    regenerated soul. It does not change according to external circumstances.
    It goes beyond the absence of strife or war. Wholeness or completeness are
    the closest words to the Hebrew rendering of the word ‘peace’. Thus to know
    true peace is both to attain personal fulfillment and to enjoy full and
    healthy relationships with God and fellow human beings (Heb. 12:14; Rom.
    12:18). In Philippians 4:7, Paul talks about the peace of God, which
    surpasses all understanding. It immune the believer’s heart and mind
    against anxiety and fear. It’s not something you can figure out, not even
    your psychologist can explain it.
</p>
<p>
    D. Patience: It is translated long-suffering in some other Bible versions.
    That is actually the idea. It is a virtue that bears long. It bears with
    the frailties and provocations of others, from the consideration that God
    has borne long with ours. It also bears up also through all the troubles
    and difficulties of life without murmuring or languishing. It submits
    cheerfully to every dispensation of God's providence, and thus deriving
    benefit from every occurrence, having the understanding that that in all
    things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called
    according to his purpose (Rom.8:28).
</p>
<p>
    E. Kindness: Rendered as gentleness in some translations, it is a virtue
    that is an outgrowth of God’s kindness that leads people to repentance (Rom
    2:4). Anyone who has benefited from God’s kind disposition is therefore
    positioned to show kindness to others. The quality of being kind includes
    being friendly, being benevolent, taking thought of others, sweetness of
    disposition, gentleness in dealing with others, affability, acts of
    hospitality, readiness to help others without strings attached, expressing
    gracious, serviceable, polite dispositions, the ability to act for the
    welfare of those getting on your nerves. It is not cranky or nasty.
</p>
<p>
    F. Goodness: This virtue takes it root from God’s good nature. It is of the
    nature of God to be good. This characteristic is not changeable or
    diminishing. It find expression in the consistent desire, not only to
    abstain from every appearance of evil, but to be and do good to others to
    the utmost of one’s ability. Christians are admonished to hold fast to that
    which is good (Gal 6:21) and seek to do good things (1Thess. 5:15) for all
    people (Gal 6:9-10. They should not neglect opportunities to be of help
    (Heb. 13:16) or be weary of doing so 2Thess. 3:13). Indeed, they should be
    `rich in good deeds' (1Tim. 6:18) and maintain a good walk before the Lord
    (1Pet. 3:16).
</p>
<p>
    G. Faithfulness: Sometimes, it is not clear whether this virtue is faith or
    faithfulness. It should however be understood that faithfulness must not be
    divorced from its relation to the believer's faith. Faith is expressed in
    an absolute commitment to the person and work of Christ. Indeed, true faith
    produces faithfulness. Thus faith and faithfulness are inevitably bound
    together, faithfulness being the natural outflow of genuine faith. The
    emphasis here refers to fidelity—which is a corollary punctuality in
    performing promises. It describes conscientious carefulness in preserving
    what is committed to one’s trust, in restoring it to its proper owner. It
    is being responsible and accountable in transacting the business one is
    entrusted with. It doesn’t betray the secret of a friend.
</p>
<p>
    H. Meekness: It is rendered gentleness in some translations, and humility
    in others. Jesus spoke of Himself, “…I am gentle and humble in heart...”
    (Matt 11:29) Meekness is the attitude of the heart that flows towards
    others, with grace. It doesn’t seek reprisals of hurts. It is not brash in
    responding to insults. In fact it is not moved by insults. This is the
    virtue that describes the attitude of believers even when defending the
    faith; they are to courteously and respectfully give an answer to anyone
    who asks about the faith (1 Pet. 3:15-16). In all these instances meekness
    is not to be equated with weakness but rather it involves an inner
    God-given strength of character, which shields a person from arrogance.
</p>
<p>
    I. Self-control: Temperance, as some translations put it, is the virtue
    that subdues the indulgent tendencies of one’s carnal faculties. It
    includes the dominion over all evil tendencies, and may denote continence,
    chastity, self-discipline, moderation in regard to all indulgences,
    including eating, drinking, sleeping and so on. The sense here is, that the
    influences of the Holy Spirit on the heart make a person moderate in all
    indulgences; instruct in restraining one’s passions, and to govern oneself;
    and to subdue all inordinate affection (Rom13:14; Titus2:2).
