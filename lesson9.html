				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>

    <strong>Text</strong>
    : Joel 2:28-29; Zechariah 4:6; Matt.28:18-20; Acts 1:4-5
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
    goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things
    there is no law.” - Acts 1:8
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line</strong>
    : The Holy Spirit was given to the disciples at Pentecost, so we also are
    given when we believe
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective</strong>
    : In this lesson, the Teens will learn that the Holy Spirit is a gift from
    God and the import of this gift in the life of a believer in evangelizing.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer is to enable
    the believer to live his life as a soul winner for Christ. He has been
    given the Holy Spirit so that he can receive power to be a witness for the
    Lord Jesus Christ. The preaching of the gospel is the primary assignment of
    every believer in Christ. We are to go out to all parts of the world to
    witness for the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
					
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The promise that the Lord Jesus Christ made to the disciples before his
    ascension was to baptize them with the Holy Spirit. The power that the
    disciples will receive after the Holy Spirit has come upon them will enable
    them to be able to stand firm in preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus
    Christ. The power will make them to become very bold and to withstand any
    form of opposition that comes their way. Whatever they are able to
    accomplish while preaching the gospel will be ascribed to be the work of
    the Holy Spirit. They will be able to baptize the converts in the name of
    the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit as well as teaching the converts
    to obey all that Jesus Christ has commanded.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Preaching The Gospel Before The Baptism of The Holy Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Before the disciples were baptized of the Holy Spirit, they were able to go
    out under the directive of the Lord Jesus Christ to various cities and
    villages to preach the gospel. However, their preaching was limited in
    scope as well as the attested signs and wonders that followed there
    ministration. The results of conversion that followed their preaching were
    limited. They encountered cases of needs for healings and deliverances that
    they could not do anything about (Matt. 17:16, John 9:2, Mark 3:14, Luke
    9:2).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Preaching The Gospel After The Baptism of The Holy Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After the disciples were baptized of the Holy Spirit, their ministrations
    and the demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit changed drastically.
    They were able to preach with boldness, they were no longer afraid of
    persecutions from the priests, Romans and fellow Jews. Peter was able to
    preach with such boldness that was not there before the baptism of the Holy
    Spirit. The result of his message brought great conversion as many people
    gave their lives to Christ and were baptized in water (Acts 2:14,37-41).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Reaching out to Jerusalem and Other Places</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The gospel is to be preached first in Jerusalem, then Judea, Samaria and
    unto the uttermost part of the world. This simply means that we are to
    begin the preaching of the gospel from our immediate environment and our
    immediate neighborhood before we venture out to places farther from where
    we are located. No place must be too far for us to reach out to with the
    gospel (Rom. 15:31, Acts 8:5, Act 18:1, Acts 19:21).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    1. How can one reach his immediate family with the gospel?
</p>
<p align="left">
    2. How can the people of our neighborhood be reached?
</p>
<p align="left">
    3. How can we extend our outreach of the preaching of the gospel to places
    and people far from us?
</p>

        personal witnessing which involves going out to meet people in their
        homes, workplace, etc., to calling through phone, using social media
