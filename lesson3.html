    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7 You
    should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' - John 3:6,
    7
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    Those who have received Christ have new life from the Holy Spirit
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    In this lesson teens will learn that when Christ is accepted as Saviour,
the Holy Spirit gives new birth to our spirit that was dead because of sin.    <strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Genesis 2:7 tells us that the first man was formed and made of the dust of
    the ground and then God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. The
    Breath of God is His Spirit, and it is clear from the passage that it is
    the Spirit who generates man from clay. The Nicene Creed calls Him “the
    Lord and Giver of life,” and it is the Spirit who generated and who
    sustains each of us in life.
    <br/>
    Because of Adam’s sin, however, all men and women are born under judgment,
    the judgment of death (Genesis 3). All humanity is dead in Adam, and this
    “death nature” works more sin in us, so that the downward spiral of death
    and sin and more death and more sin is manifest in the life of every
    person. If we are going to have life, it is necessary for the Spirit of God
    to break the cycle of death and sin and breathe new life into us. This
    process is called the New Birth or regeneration.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Nathaniel M. Van Cleave commented on our topic and said: “We must remember
    that the Spirit is sent by the Father for the purpose of bringing man to
    the realization and the successful attainment of His created purpose. Being
    that redemption and eternal life with God are only obtainable through faith
    in the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is understandable that the
    principal work of the Holy Spirit is to bring man to the place where they
    will believe on Christ and enter into the life obtainable only through such
    belief. Jesus emphasized and designated that the basic Holy Spirit ministry
    would be that which would bring man to this place of faith. No one can
    produce conviction in the heart of another. Only the Holy Spirit can
    overcome the blindness and deceitfulness of the sinful, human heart and
    make a man realize the greatness of his own iniquity.”

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The New Birth is the Sovereign work of the Holy Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    According to Ephesians 2, we were dead in trespasses and sins. We need to
    be born again in order to be a part of God’s family. We must be resurrected
    from the dead and born again into a new life. But a dead corpse cannot
    decide to come to life again, and spiritually dead people cannot decide to
    be born again. Just as we had nothing to do with creating ourselves in the
    first place, and just as we had nothing to do with being born, so we have
    nothing to do with our new birth, recreation, resurrection, and
    regeneration. The new birth is the sovereign work of God the Holy Spirit.
    Left to ourselves we would never turn to God (John 6:44). We don’t choose
    to be born again. It is by the Spirit. Being born again is by grace alone.
    When we make a decision to turn from sin and receive Christ, it is because
    of the Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The New Birth is the Beginning of a New Life </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A genuine Christ-like love will be one specific result in life (1 Jn. 4:7).
    Another effect of the new birth is overcoming the world (1 Jn. 5:3-4).
</p>
<p>
    Here John explains that regeneration gives the ability to overcome the
    pressures and temptations of the world that would otherwise keep us from
    obeying God’s commandments and following His paths. John says that we will
    overcome these pressures and therefore it will not be “burdensome” to obey
    God’s commands but, he implies, it will rather be joyful. He goes on to
    explain that the process through which we gain victory over the world is
    continuing in faith (1 John 5:4). A man who has been born again of the
    Spirit of God will repent and turn to God from all his sins. He will mourn
    over them, flee them, hate them, desire to be free from them and seek the
    face of God in Christ so his sins may be put beneath His precious blood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>You Must be Born Again</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A man must be born anew, else he cannot see the kingdom of God. One life
    must be destroyed and give place to another. The life of the flesh must
    give way to the life of the Spirit: that is the only way in which any one
    can enter the kingdom of God; the new birth is the only manner in which new
    members are ever being won to it. The kingdom of God in each person is joy
    in the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Nicodemus sees in Jesus a genuine divine activity. He admits that Jesus is
    from God. Jesus does the works of God. To this, Jesus does not respond by
    saying, “I wish everyone in Palestine could see the truth that you see
    about me.” Instead, he says, “You must be born again or you will never see
    the kingdom of God.” What matters is not merely affirming the supernatural
    in Jesus but experiencing the supernatural in yourself. The new birth is
    supernatural, not natural. It cannot be accounted by things that are
    already found in this world. So, there is no spiritual life — no eternal
    life — apart from connection with Jesus and belief in Jesus. We will have
    lots more to say about the relationship between the new birth and faith in
    Jesus. But let’s put it this way for now: In the new birth, the Holy Spirit
    unites us to Christ in a living union. Christ is life. Christ is the vine
    where life flows. We are the branches (
    <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2015.1ff" target="_blank">
        John 15:1ff
    </a>
    ). What happens in the new birth is the supernatural creation of new
    spiritual life, and it is created through union with Jesus Christ. The Holy
    Spirit brings us into vital connection with Christ who is the way, the
    truth, and life. That is the objective reality of what happens in the new
    birth.
