				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Christian life seems to be a bit of a battle most of the time.
</p>
<p>
    In an age when we are bombarded every day with music, magazines on the
    shelf, billboards on the road and movies all sending out the wrong
    messages, we are faced with pressures that takes their toll on our faith.
    We live in a culture where people’s priority is to keep up with the newest
    styles, go with the flow, work out, stay trim, have a boyfriend or
    girlfriend, and get into school, get a really good job, drive a cool car
    and be the happening guy. Quite a suffocation, and it could be so
    frustrating when you try to get a bit spiritual, you want to do the right
    thing, you want to rep Christ, you even but you seem to be making so little
    progress. Sometimes you are up, but most of the time you are very aware of
    your downs. Everything is a struggle: you struggle with reading your Bible,
    you struggle with praying, you struggle not to tell a lie, you struggle
    with lust, and you struggle with self-control. There’s no end to the list.
    If this is the way you feel, you need to know that you are not alone.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus had announced His impending death earlier to His disciples several
    times before this final warning. During this final warning and after
    instituting the Lord’s Supper, they sang a hymn and went out into Mount of
    Olives. As they were leaving, Jesus announced that all of them will desert
    him. Peter, so cocksure, rejected the idea that at least he could never
    turn his back on Jesus. Jesus responds to Peter specifically, telling him
    that he will deny Him three times before sunrise. Then Peter vehemently
    boasted that he was willing to die for Jesus. Peter had good intention but
    it seems that Peter never imagined that his commitment would be put to a
    test.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Causes of Struggling Faith</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Struggling faith is a wavering or faltering faith (Heb. 10:23, Jam. 1:6),
    staggering faith (Rom. 4:20), stumbling faith (Rom. 9:31-32). What causes
    our faith to struggle or waver? Let us explore from the text given to us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    Self-confidence and pride. The problem of “I.” “But Peter said unto him,
    “Although all shall be offended, <strong>yet will not I” </strong>(Mark
    14:29-31, Pro. 3:5).<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    B. Lack of watchfulness (v.34, 37, 40).
</p>
<p>
    C. Problem of sin/flesh (v.38).
</p>
<p>
    D. Fear and threats (vv.66-71).
</p>
<p>
    E. Focus on circumstances rather than God vv.66-71).
</p>
<p>
    F. Ignorance of the Word of God.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Consequences of Struggling Faith </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    What are the manifestations or symptoms of struggling Faith?
</p>
<p>
    A. Denial of faith: Failure to stand up when it matters most, to stand up
    for Christ, or for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
    B. Becoming unstable (James 1:6-8)
</p>
<p>
    C. Misleading others (vv.66-71)
</p>
<p>
    D. Making wrong and costly decisions (v.71)
</p>
<p>
    E. Loss of peace and joy (v.72). Peter wept bitterly.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Cure for Struggling Faith</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. Being strong in the Lord (Eph. 6:10, Psa. 28:7-8)
</p>
<p>
    B. Drawing strength from the Word (Psa. 119:28)
</p>
<p>
    C. Waiting on the Lord (Isa. 40:29-31)
</p>
<p>
    D. Understanding the sufficiency of God’s grace (2 Cor. 12:9-10)
</p>
<p>
    E. Taking your stand and courageously choosing to obey (Acts 5:29, Dan.
    3:15-18).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways do we compromise our faith?
</p>
<p>
    2. Would your faith hold up under the pressure of trial and temptation or
    even persecution?
</p>
<p>
    3. What does it mean to stand up for Jesus?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
Peter’s denial of Christ was heart rendering, “    <em>I do not know this Man of whom you speak!”</em> Both from his action
    and speech, he failed Jesus. He trusted in himself and flesh failed him.
    Our confidence must never rest in our ability but in the power of God to
    overcome life challenges.
