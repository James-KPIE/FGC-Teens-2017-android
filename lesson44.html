				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Serving neighbours, serving God—the question whether one relates with the
    other comes to mind, shouldn’t they be mutually exclusive, is one more
    important than the other, who is my neighbour? In today’s lesson, Jesus
    clarifies these questions, in response to a certain lawyer or scribe, who
    actually came to tease Jesus but ended up being the victim of his own
    mischief.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The lawyer in the story was an expert in the Jewish law, (not a barrister
    at law) who knew and understood the details of the Jewish religion and
    traditions. He was more or less an Old Testament scholar, otherwise called
    a scribe. His speciality was in the Torah— the five books of Moses. The
    scribe came to ask Jesus a question, “what must I do to inherit eternal
    life” (v.25)? It was a good question asked with a bad motive, because the
    lawyer’s original intent was test Jesus. He wasn’t really seeking to be
    taught by Jesus, nor was he interested in finding the way to eternal life.
    He was only out to fault Jesus’ views about matters of the law. Jesus
    replied by referring His questioner back to the law. After all, as teacher
    of the law, he should know better. As expected, the scribe gave the right
    answer, quoting from Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18. Jesus,
    acknowledge the correctness of his answer, and told him, “Do this and you
    will live” (v. 28). That didn’t seems to go down with the lawyer well, he
    gets defensive, especially about the “Love your neighbour as yourself”
    (v.27) part of the answer. Feeling obligated to justify himself, he asks
    Jesus a second question, “And who is my neighbour?” (v.29) Jesus answered
    him with the story of the Good Samaritan (vv. 30-35).

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Example of Good Neighbourliness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The hero in Jesus’ story was the most unlikely person— the Samaritan. This
    wouldn’t sound so good in the ears of the lawyer who was a Jew and belonged
    to the elite class like the priest and the Levite in the story. Samaritans
    were disliked and disparaged by Jews. They were considered as outcast,
    unholy and without class. But in this narrative the priest and the Levite,
    who were actually the most esteemed stock of the Jewish religion, as a
    matter of status and profession, didn’t live up to expectation. They were
    supposed to be custodians of the same law about loving one’s neighbour,
    which their lawyer kin claimed to know, but as it turned out they goofed.
    They walked past a human being, mugged badly hurt and desperately needing
    help and left him for the dead. When the Samaritan, who actually on journey
    got to the crime scene, he stopped everything for the sake of the wounded
    stranger. It didn’t matter to him if he was going to miss his appointment.
    It didn’t matter whether the guy was a Jew, Samaritan or gentile. This was
    a fellow human being, who needed help, and as long as it was within his
    capacity, the Samaritan was willing to help. He went all the way to ensure
    the care and the recovery of the injured stranger. In many ways, the
    Samaritan was different from the two religious leaders, but one thing that
    especially distinguishes the Samaritan from the Jews, was compassion. When
    the two Jewish religious leaders saw the injured man, they seem to be
    repulsed, just ignored and avoided him. The Samaritan, on the other hand
    moved with compassion, did everything possible to minister to the needs of
    the injured victim. The Samaritan sacrificed his time and money to help
    this stranger. Compassion, as used in our text draws on the Hebrew concept
    faithfulness between individuals that results in human kindness, mercy, and
    pity. It is an outgrowth of godly piety as underscored in Micah 6:8: "He
    has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you?
    To act justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.” Now
    Jesus drives home His point. He asks the lawyer which of the three proved
    to be a neighbour to the wounded man, and the lawyer, now feeling cornered,
    was forced to reply, “The one who had mercy on him” (v.37). To the distaste
    of the lawyer, the Samaritan gets the award of good neighbourliness, and to
    add insult to injury, he gets to announce the award.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Ethic of Godly Neighbourliness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jesus admonishes the lawyer, “go and do likewise” in consistence with the
    earlier admonition following the lawyer's answer to the first question, “do
    this and you will live.” (v.28). For Jesus it wasn’t enough just to define
    what neighbour means or to argue about and around the technicalities of
    neighbourliness. He commands the lawyer to follow the Samaritan’s example
    of neighbourliness, to show mercy to a fellow human being who is in need.
    Neighbourliness was a big issue for the Jews because of the characteristic
    exclusiveness of the people. They were self-consciousness of being the
    ‘chosen ones’ sealed in the rite of circumcision. They had a superiority
complex, in Nigerian parlance what would be referred to as the “    <em>I better pass my neighbour</em>” mentality. This complex of being the
    ‘elected ones’ made them particularly loyal to their own kind and, at the
    same time, permitted the tendency to be prejudiced and even hostile to
    non-Israelites. It is therefore not surprising that the priest and Levite
    failed the test of neighbourliness in our text. This was in spite of the
    legislations Moses gave them to encourage compassion and justice for the
    non-Jew, For example, the prohibition of harvesting crops entirely;
    instead, some crops were to be left for the poor and the alien ( Lev.
    19:9-10 ); and every third year a tithe was to be shared with the
    sojourners ( Deut. 14:29 ; 26:12-13 ). Essentially, the Mosaic laws demand
    both compassion and justice to be guaranteed for the foreigner because God
    loves the sojourner (Deut. 10:18). But the traditions of the people
    overtime became contrary to what was supposed to be the norm. To Jesus, the
    story of the Good Samaritan illustrates how the two most important
    commandments in Deuteronomy 6: 4–5 (“you shall love the Lord your God…”)
    and Leviticus 19: 18 (“you shall love your neighbour as yourself”), are
    intimately connected. The love of neighbour springs from God’s love for
    creation. The commitment to others, therefore, is an expression of the
    faith in God and commitment to God, as God commits to human beings in His
    creation.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. How do you understand the concept of neighbourliness from today’s
    lesson?
</p>
<p>
    2. How is it applicable in our everyday living?
</p>
<p>
    3. What tendencies of “I better pass my neighbour” have you noticed with
    church people, how do such attitude negate good neighbourliness?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Our memory verse (Matthew 7:12) captures one of the most profound
    statements that the Jesus ever made. “Therefore, whatever you want men to
    do to you, do also to them, for this is the law and the prophets.” It is
    often called the ‘golden rule’ of life. The golden rule does not teach that
    we are to do to others what we would like them to do to us in order that
    they will do it to us. For example, you buy your friend lunch, so he or she
    will by you lunch some other day. Jesus speaks of an unconditional love.
    When we do good to others, we expect nothing in return. A better way to
    interpret the rule is that we are to do to others as we would like to have
    done to ourselves if we were placed in their condition. If you do that, you
    can never go wrong. This resonates with the principle of neighbourliness,
    “Love your neighbour as yourself.”
</p>
<p>
    2. Neighbourliness is understood as a response to the challenge of meeting
    human needs, indiscriminately. Being or becoming a neighbour, therefore, to
    Christians means taking responsibility for others out of compassion—not the
    easy, emotional compassion, but the tough, demanding compassion that
    answers the call to commitment, whether or not the object of our compassion
    is deserving.
</p>
<p>
    3. This way we share the God kind of love with others, serving God in our
    neighbourly response to humanity.
