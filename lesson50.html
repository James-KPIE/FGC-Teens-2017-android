				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    A woman saw a little boy holding a sparrow with a broken wing. She said,
    “Son, would you like me to take this sparrow home and nurse it back to
    health? I promise to bring it back to you.” The little boy thought for a
    moment and then said “if you don’t mind, I’ll take care of it myself,
    because, you see, I understand this bird.” The woman didn’t understand what
    he meant until he stood. Then she saw that his left leg was in a cast.
    Because he was crippled, he understood the problem of the suffering bird.
</p>
<p>
    Jesus is both human and divine. He came to earth and lived as a man. He was
    subjected to all the trials and testings’ of life, yet without sin.
    Therefore, as our High Priest, He is able to sympathise and empathise with
    us; He understands our feelings because He was tested and lived like us. He
    knows when we are lonely and misunderstood. He understands when we are
    discouraged, dejected and disappointed. He knows everything we are passing
    through. He is aware of all. As we go through this lesson, be assured that
    he will speak to you.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Scripture in Matthew 6:9-13 is the picture of the prayer pattern the
    Lord taught His disciples. According to Kenneth Boa, there are eight forms
    of prayers from the above passages, which are: adoration, confession,
    renewal, petition, intercession, affirmation, thanksgiving and closing
    prayer. The focus of this lesson is an aspect of the Lord’s Prayer which is
    “intercession.”

				<h3>Lesson Outline</h3>
				<div><p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Christ Our High Priest (Heb. 4:14-15, 15:1)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Christ Our Helper (Heb. 4:146)</strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Christ our High Priest </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Following the earlier discourse from the beginning of this book, chapters
    1-4:13, the crux of the matter is Christ, as we see Christ’s glorious work
    and His exaltation, the pre-eminence of Christ’s message, pre-eminence of
    His glory and finally entering into rest by faith in Christ Jesus. Having
    charged us to pay more attention to God’s Word that we believe, the writer
    shifts to a dire need of “High Priest” – Jesus – the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
    Since we believe that Christ is both divine and human, and by our
    confession of trust in Him, then His understanding should spur in us
    boldness and courage to approach Him – a direct access without any
    inhibition or constraint. Why? Because:
</p>
<p>
    He understands our frailty - our weakness, feebleness.
</p>
<p>
    He knows by experience what it means to be tempted.
</p>
<p>
    Though, His kind of temptation may not be particularly like ours, but
    generally, He experienced temptation in the three basic areas of human
    predisposition: body, soul and spirit (physically, morally and
    spiritually).
</p>
<p>
    What kind of infirmity/weakness/temptation/habits are we plagued with? How
    deep are we in such situation? How long has the situation been harassing
    and embarrassing us? Is there a way out? Like Paul said: “who can deliver
    me from…
</p>
<p>
    Jesus, our high priest is the way out – of sickness, habit etc. He was
    tempted as we are, so He can sympathise with us. He was perfectly
    victorious. He faced temptation and did not sin.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Christ our Helper </strong>
</p>
<p>
    To help means—to do part and to assist another to remedy etc. Help is an
    act of bearing another’s burden or support. There is a common saying that
    “heaven helps those who help themselves.” This is an untrue statement as
    regard spiritual walk of believers – “heaven helps those who cannot help
    themselves.” Christ is not only our intercessor, not only our mediator, He
    is also our helper who is willing and ready to help if only we can approach
    the throne of grace boldly in prayer. He is never asleep and there is no
    danger that you will be forgotten. Elijah ridiculed the prophets of baal by
    sacrificially suggesting their god was asleep when they needed him (1 Kings
    18:27). But our God never sleeps nor slumbers. He is willing and ready to
    help you (Psa. 46:1, 121:1, Isa. 41:10). Which area of life do you need
    God’s help? Do you need help?
</p>
<p>
    - To overcome sin
</p>
<p>
    - To gain your freedom from harmful practices
</p>
<p>
    - In your academic/career pursuit
</p>
<p>
    - For healing in your body
</p>
<p>
    - In joblessness
</p>
<p>
    Lift your eyes above and beyond to the Lord who made heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>

</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    Jesus is praying for you! Jesus is praying for me!! Jesus is praying for
    all those who have confessed Him their Lord and personal Saviour (Jn.
    17:20). In His earthly ministry, He prayed for His disciple and others. And
    in Heaven from His right hand side of the Father, He is seated interceding
