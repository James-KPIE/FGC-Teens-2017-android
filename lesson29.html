			<h2>Lesson 29</h2><h2>Saul Begins to Preach</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Acts 9:19b-31
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “And after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several
    days with the disciples in Damascus. At once he began to preach in the
    synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.”
</p>
<p>
    Acts 9:19-20
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    We are to tell others about the gospel of Jesus Christ as soon as we get
    saved.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will encourage the teens to preach Jesus Christ as the Son of
    God and Savior of the world.

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Anani grew up in the Middle East learning to wage jihad against all
    non-Muslims, especially Jews and Christians. For years, he did that. Anani
    belonged to several Islamic terrorist groups in Lebanon. By 14, he had
    already committed his first murder, and within four years, he had 223 kills
    to his credit. Amazingly, the same Christian faith that Anani had wanted to
    crush eventually changed his life. After a chance encounter with a
    Christian preacher on a street in Lebanon, Anani left Islam and terrorism
    at the age of 17. He has now devoted his life to speaking out against
    radical Islam and standing up for Christ. His family reacted by disowning
    him. His father shredded his first Bible, and slapped him severally.
    Outside his home, things were even worse. He was dragged to the local
    mosque, beaten and excommunicated. There were also several attempts on his
    life. But Anani refused to be intimidated or be swayed from his new faith.
    Anani now lives in North America, where he is director of evangelism for an
    International ministry. His time in the West hasn’t always gone smoothly
    either. He has been assaulted and seen his life threatened by Muslims in
    the United States and Canada. Anani’s story seems to be a re-enactment of
    Saul of Tarsus’ conversion in our text.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The conversion of Saul of Tarsus, the leading persecutor of the Christians
    in the early church, was perhaps the greatest event in church history after
    the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost. Saul met Christ in a unique
    encounter on his way to Damascus where he was headed to legally persecute
    the Christians in that city. While his Jewish allies were piqued by his
    conversion to Christianity and attempted to kill him, his conversion story
    was met with scepticism, among the Christians, who couldn’t come to terms
    with the fact that the number one Enemy of the Church was now a changed
    person, and a professed Christian at that. “It must definitely be a set
    up”, they must have thought.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Persecutor Becomes A Preacher</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Saul wasted no time in transferring his former zeal into his new found
    faith, realising how much time he had wasted fighting Christ in the name of
    religion. Shortly after his conversion, he began to testify of the same
    Christ he once persecuted to everyone’s amazement. The question on the
    people’s lips was “isn’t he the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem among
    those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as
    prisoners to the chief priests?<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Persecutor Becomes The Persecuted</strong>
</p>
<p>
    What goes around comes around. Saul the persecutor now becomes the
    persecuted. Saul’s unwavering boldness at preaching the gospel was
    unwelcomed by his fellow unbelieving Jews who see Christians as
    blasphemers. They planned to kill Saul but his new friends and followers
helped him to escape safely out of Damascus and went back to Jerusalem    <strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Persecutor Becomes Proven</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Back in Jerusalem, Saul had a very poor reception from the believers there,
    because they knew who he was and the mission that took him out of Jerusalem
    to Damascus. It was unimaginable to assume such a high profile “terrorist”
    was now a believer. Saul needed someone to speak for him so he could be
    accepted into the believer’s fold and Barnabas (as his name implies, son of
    consolation) came to his rescue. Having won the confidence of the Christian
    fold, Saul at once began to preach again. Persecution arose once again from
    the Grecian Jews to kill him but he was helped by his fellow believers to
    escape to his home town, Tarsus.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What parallels can you draw from the story of Anani and the life of
    Saul?
</p>
<p>
    2. What is the significance of Barnabas’ role in helping Saul settle into
    the Christian community?
</p>
<p>
    3. What risks have you taken in sharing your faith?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    There was an urgency in the way Saul handled his new found faith. He wasted
    no time to make known that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Savior of the
    whole world. As teenagers we should be pretty excited about sharing our
    faith with others, just as we should be aware that our faith will be
    tested. Persecution may come either from within or outside, but we must
    continue to proclaim Jesus as Lord and Savior. Also, we must understand
    that there is no sinner so bad, who God cannot save. There’s always pardon
    from Jesus for the even the vilest offender who truly believes. Saul and
    Anani are living testimonies to this.
