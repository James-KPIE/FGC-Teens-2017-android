				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Seven years ago, the Nigerian government under President Umar Musa Yar’adua
    started the amnesty program for militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
    Amnesty meant that the sin of sabotaging the economy was forgiven, and so
    militants, in realizing their folly and surrendering their arms, will be
    able to live a responsible and better life. Amnesty also meant that
    militants will get paid, even get trained or schooled as the case may be.
    In July 29, 2016 three out of the former militants graduated from a London
    University with First Class Honors, while 18 graduated with Second Class
    Upper division. This goes to show what can happen when people seize the
    opportunity to turn from being bad to good.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In the days of prophet Ezekiel, the people of Judah gave themselves up to
    reckless abandon in sin. God dealt with them by allowing other countries
    invade and rule over them and even take them captives. The climax was the
    invasion of and eventually captivity by Babylon. Instead of them to repent,
    they became bitter, conceited and rebellious. They coined a proverb that
    denied God’s justice, and generalized judgement by nullifying God’s
    fairness in dealing with individuals. Living in denial of the repercussions
    of their sins, they played the victim, assuming they were being punished
    for the sins of their ancestors. God was however set to expose their
    hypocrisy, in overtly doling out judgement as they deserved.

				<h3>Lesson Outline</h3>

    guilt.

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. How does verse 20 of our text address the notion of those who think they
    are saved because they were born into a Christian family?
</p>
<p>
    2. Why do you think it is difficult for some people to change from their
    wrong doing?
</p>
<p>
    3. What do you make of Isaiah 1:18 in the light of today’s lesson?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    If a human being could grant a fellow human being amnesty, how much more
    God who has the inalienable capacity to forgive sins. It is in God’s nature
    to forgive sins. For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
    no longer counting people's sins against them (2 Cor. 5:19). God’s appeal
    for repentance still stands today. It doesn’t matter how deep in sin you
    might fallen, it doesn’t matter all the bad things you might have done, you
    just need to come back to God and repent of your sins. For God made Christ,
    who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made
    right with God through Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). The point is that the
    provision for our justification is a done deal in Christ. We only need to
    take advantage of God’s gracious call to repentance. I don't want you to
    die, says the Sovereign Lord. Turn back and live! (Ezek. 18:32)
