    <strong>
        Biblical Truths: It's What the Foursquare Church Believes In<em>.</em>
    </strong>
    
</p>
 
<p class="article">
    Yes! We welcome the New Year, 2017. May the year bring God’s unfailing love
    to you and your family as you pursue the BEST for this group of people
    called the Teens or Youth-the NEXT generation of leaders. In their
    characteristic economy, they don’t want to be bothered with things that
    they perceive will make no difference in their lives.
</p>
<p class="article">
    If we as adults, will be supportive to them in this difficult age (while
    taking every opportunity afforded to teach them) then we must be able to
    make God important enough for them that they must bother to know more about
    Him. Our delivery of information about God matters most. By remembering the
    needs of Youth (acceptance, self-awareness, growth to physical and mental
    maturity, separation from parents, new relations to peers, etc.) we can
    present some of the mysteries of God in a way that is truthful and
    acceptable by asking questions and letting the teens seek the answers from
    the source of all Truth- God Himself and from His Word, the Bible. God will
    be more important to them at this stage if they can see some clear
    connection between their lives (and the associated pain, struggle, hardship
    and loneliness) and God’s provision for them. Thus the theme of this study:
    “Dwelling in the Realm of the Holy Spirit.”
</p>
<p class="article">
    Essentially, we need to show them that the Bible has answers for all of
    their needs. Sharing that one basic concept with them will encourage them
    to learn more about what God has to say. This will subsequently empower
    them with knowledge that can affect their lives every day. Hebrews 10:22
    states that we should draw near to God with a true heart in full assurance
    of faith.
</p>
<p class="article">
    We must remember that the infinite God is not limited by space. He is
    Omnipresent. His omnipresence provides no comfort or aid to those who
    refuse to obey; but it is a great source of blessing and comfort to those
    whose heart is right before Him.
</p>
<p class="article">
    Dwelling in the realm of the Holy Spirit requires that we should allow the
    Spirit to have a working relationship with us by letting He Himself dwell
    in us and direct our daily affairs. We must willingly submit to God’s will
    and obey His Word. Then, it will be easier for our students to follow suit.
    God will give understanding in this matter.
</p>
<p class="article">
    Do your best to prepare your lesson very well each week and be soaked in
    the realm of the Spirit so that the Spirit can indwell you for greater
    works (2 Tim. 2:15; John 1:50). God will give you insight to these lessons
    as you release yourself to be used by Him through the power of the Holy
    Spirit. I wish you a great time of illumination and power to receive same
    in Jesus name. Amen!
</p>
<p class="article">
    Thank you, <em>HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR</em> in Jesus Name!

    <strong>Effective Nuggets for The Teacher</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <u></u>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Importance of the Sunday School</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    Sunday school is an educational arm of the Church that provides a
    curriculum of Bible Study with particular emphasis to establish souls in
    Christ Jesus. Its values or importance cannot be exhausted.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Sunday school offers:
</p>
<p align="center">
    1. Better place and opportunity for teachers to carefully take God’s word
    and apply it to daily lives and problems of the students.
</p>
<p align="center">
    2. It enlists more people into a systematic study of God’s word.
</p>
<p align="center">
    3. It provides close contact among Brethren.
</p>
<p align="center">
    4. It is the fulfillment of the great commission (Matthew 28:18-20)
</p>
<p align="center">
    5. It helps students to have a better understanding of Christian life.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Consequent to the above values of Sunday School, the Pastor and Sunday
    School Board should set for themselves definite objectives and work towards
    the realization of such for development of Sunday School Ministry and the
    Church. “Grow Sunday School grow your Church.”
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit Empowerment in your Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    Teaching or service done in the energy of the flesh is of little value. The
    Holy Spirit’s power is then needed because:
</p>
<p align="center">
    1. The Holy Spirit is the engine oil or lubricant that enhances smoothness
    and effectiveness in your teaching.
</p>
<p align="center">
    2. He enlightens, enables and guides us as we prepare and teach.
</p>
<p align="center">
    3. His power is needed for the Word of God to be effective in students’
    lives.
</p>
<p align="center">
    4. His power is essential to understand the truth (2 Cor. 2:12-15)
</p>
<p align="center">
    5. His power is needed because without Him, we can do nothing.
</p>
<p align="center">
    6. His power will remove people’s spiritual blindness and regeneration will
    take place.
</p>
<p align="center">
    It is no gain saying therefore that both the teacher and the learner have
    great need of the breath of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Preparing Your Sunday School Lesson</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    1. Start lesson preparation on Monday, so your experiences during the week
    may be incorporated in your teaching.
</p>
<p align="center">
    2. Have a central aim in your lesson.
</p>
<p align="center">
    3. Read the scripture passages from several versions for clarification.
</p>
<p align="center">
    4. Develop a clear outline and points of emphasis from the manual.
</p>
<p align="center">
    5. Arrange time for prayer, review, Bible reading, discussion, student’s
    book, memory work, application and closing. But be FLEXIBLE!
</p>
<p align="center">
    6. Remember the needs of individuals in your class (discover these through
    visitation to their home and personal counseling sessions with
    students).Keep in mind that you are teaching persons and not just a lesson.
</p>
<p align="center">
    7. Know the age level characteristics of the group you are teaching.
</p>
<p align="center">
    8. Develop your lesson note for each topic, to add illustrations, outlines
    and other teachings aids each year you continue to teach.
</p>
<p align="center">
    9. Know the work required in the student’s workbook. Determine how to use
    it in class review, work period, and discussion.
</p>
<p align="center">
    10. Plan an interesting approach to capture attention. This may be a
    question to stimulate thought, a problem to solve, a true-to-life story to
    illustrate the lesson.
</p>
<p align="center">
    11. Plan a variety of methods, visual, object lesson, drama, stories, sword
    drills, questions and answers, discussion and so forth.
</p>
<p align="center">
    12. Plan thoroughly class participation methods.
</p>
<p align="center">
    13. Develop study questions to cause the students search the Bible for
    themselves. Ask them: who, what, when, where, why? (For example: Ask, “What
    does the Bible say…? etc.
</p>
<p align="center">
    14. Allow students to ask questions. If you don’t know the answer, admit it
    and state you will seek the answer during the week, or assign the question
    to the class for further study.
</p>
<p align="center">
    15. Prepare the room before the class period, arranging chair, visual aid
    equipment, decorations, and objects.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Pray for wisdom in preparation, clarity in presentation, and sincerity in
    application.

<h3>Our Legacy of Foursquare Doctrine</h3>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    One of the distinguishing qualities for which our Foursquare Movement is
    renown and respected world-wide is its scripturally- balanced, solid and
    sound doctrines based on the unerring Word of God. This is the reason why
    since its inception in 1923, the Movement has not only waxed great, but is
    also spreading like wild fire throughout the globe.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The founder of the Movement, Aimee Semple McPherson said,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is the most
            beautiful Gospel in the world.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    It presents Jesus Christ as the four Gospels writers did. The Gospel of
    Luke presents Jesus as the Saviour of the world, while Apostle John, the
    beloved in his own gospel presents Jesus Christ as the Baptizer with the
    Holy Spirit. On the other hand, Mark presents Jesus as the Great
    never-failing Physician and Matthew presents Jesus Christ as the soon
    coming King.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    I am very much privileged to have come across the most beautiful Gospel in
    the universe since 1958 and after two years became a member and a
    front-line worker of the<strong><em> </em></strong>about a half billion
    adherents of the Movement.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our 22 tenets of faith are treated in detail to give no room for
    gainsayers. The Holy Scriptures are meticulously presented that there is
    hardly any reasonable piece of information one desires to know about the
    Holy Bible that our declaration of faith does not furnish. Similarly, the
    Eternal Godhead, our second tenet of faith was beautifully and clearly
    treated including the most disputable topic of Trinity. The universally
    accepted Athanasian Creed which is self-explicit and still stands
    unparalleled till the present time was quoted to make the topic very clear
    to any unbiased mind.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Fall of Man and Plan of Redemption are treated as clearly depicted by
    the Holy Scriptures to give no man to boast of his redemption but rather to
    thank God. The New Birth and Daily Christian Living are treated in such
    graciousness that every believer should thank Jesus Christ for His precious
    blood shed on the cross for the eternal life we enjoy by His painful death.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as well as The Baptism of the Holy Spirit
    are treated with constant reminiscence of the price Jesus paid for every
    redeemed soul. The Spirit –filled Life and The Gifts and Fruits of the
    Spirit, Moderation and Divine Healing are treated in our declaration of
    Faith to make every recipient of these virtues a debtor to Christ be
    grateful to Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Second Coming of Christ and Church Relationship are so elaborately
    treated that every believer should not only keep watching but also working
    relentlessly for the imminent return of the glorified Jesus, making good
    use of the grace, gifts and talents bestowed on him or her by the Master
    and fulfilling their obligations to the Church of Christ on earth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Final Judgment speaks for itself. That the certainty of God’s judgment
    is inevitable; while the believers will appear before the judgment seat of
    Christ only to receive their rewards, Satan, his horde and the unsaved as
    well as Death and Hades will be judged and cast into the lake of fire. This
    is clearly treated in our declaration of faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Heaven and Hell are often spoken of on earth. There is no right-thinking
    person who does not believe in the two places except the atheists who deny
    the existence of God. To live soberly and righteously to gain Heaven and
    shun Hell is well treated in our tenets of Faith as well.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Spirit of Evangelism, the 21<sup>st</sup> tenet of our faith is given
    an appropriate treatment in our declaration of faith. That we should
    “gospelize” the good news not only by our lips but also by our lives which,
    through the power of the Holy Spirit, draws souls to the exalted Christ is
    equally emphasized in our declaration of faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Tithes and Offerings, though the last but not the least of our tenets is
    well treated to enable the Church of Christ on earth carry out the last
    command of the risen Christ to His Church on earth. “
    <strong>
        <em>
            The last command of the risen Jesus Christ to His disciples is our
            first mandate on earth.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This inspiring and heart-motivating inscription was conspicuously displayed
    on the Church building of one of our Churches in Oregon State- ‘To run with
    the command of the risen Lord, making Christ known and accepted as the only
    Messiah of the world calls for tithes and offerings of His children. These
    obligations are well taught in our declaration of faith.’
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Dear brethren, it is a privilege and life span opportunity for you not only
    to be a member of the Foursquare Movement but also to sit at the feet of
    Jesus in our millions of Sunday School classes to study the Word so as to
    be workers who need not to be ashamed of spreading the gospel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God bless you all in Jesus’ miracle-working name.
