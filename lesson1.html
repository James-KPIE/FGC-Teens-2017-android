    <strong>Who Is The Holy Spirit?</strong>

<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    John 14:16-17,25-26; 15:26; 16:12-15;Matt. 28:19, Gen.1:2;1:26;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
    of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” - Matthew 28:19
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    The Holy Spirit is a part of the Godhead, equal with the Father and the Son
    because He is God.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    In this lesson teens will learn who the Holy Spirit is. They will
    understand His personality, attributes and power.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Holy Spirit is both God and a Person just as Jesus and God the Father
    are. Together the three Persons are the Trinity. This lesson introduces the
    Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not an abstract concept, a faceless force,
    or an “it.” He is a Person, just as God the Father and Jesus the Son are
    Persons. Your task as the teacher, with God’s help, is to help the teens
    discover the Holy Spirit as a Person who is God. The Trinity and the
    personhood of the Holy Spirit may be hard to grasp. Your goal is to make
    this important teaching more concrete so the teens can begin to grasp it.
    What better way to approach it than as an investigation? Just as forensic
    scientists seek for the truth, through this session you and your teens will
    seek for truth about the Holy Spirit.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Bible does not explain, but it does most certainly reveal the Trinity
    of the Godhead. It teaches that there is but one God, yet He has chosen to
    manifest Himself in three distinct personalities. The Holy Spirit is a
    personality distinct from the Father and Son. But it is still more
    difficult for many to visualize the Holy Spirit as a definite personality.
</p>
<p>
    So many speak of the Spirit merely as an influence or a power, a
    manifestation of the divine nature, an agent rather than a person. So often
    He is spoken of as “it.” So many pray for the power of the Spirit, asking
    God to send “it” into their midst. This should never be. The Spirit is not
    merely an influence or a figure of speech. The Holy Spirit is a definite,
    distinct personality. God will give us insight to a clearer understanding
    about the Trinity in this lesson.

    <strong>Teacher:</strong>
    Give a home assignment for the next class.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Suggestion for Teachers Illustration <em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Use a boiled egg or three entwined rings, probably with different
        colors.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Although it may not be a perfect representation, yet it can lead you and
    your students closer to near understanding.
</p>
<p>
    1. God is one complete being in three distinct persons:
</p>
<p>
    2. Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    3. God is three persons in One: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    4. Each one is fully God: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
    Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    5. There are however not three Gods.
</p>
<p>
    6. The Bible says that there is only one true God (Deut. 6:4).
</p>
<p>
    7. Just as there are not three eggs, there is only one.
</p>
<p>
    8. And yet there are three parts that make up this object.
</p>
<p>
    9. Allow some time for the teens to reflect on this truth through your
    illustration.
</p>
<p>
    10. Emphasize the limit of human understanding.
</p>
<p>
    11. Lead them to pray as follows:
</p>
<p>
    “Lord, help us to understand who You are more and more every day. You are
    an Awesome God and we desire to know You more! In Jesus name, Amen!”
