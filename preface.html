</p>


<p class="article">
    It’s so thrilling to be alive! It’s not just about being alive, but that we
    are alive as significant participators in God’s purpose on earth. He
    counted us worthy to be labourers in His vineyard and vessels of His glory.
    Every new day is an indication that God has not finished with us yet, we
    are not yet done on this side of eternity. There’s still so much to be
    done, there’s a lot in store for us to accomplish as children and
    messengers of God.
</p>
<p class="article">
    However, we can hardly accomplish anything without Him. It’s “not by might
    nor by power, but by my Spirit,” says the LORD Almighty (Zech. 4:6).
Certainly, if we are going to journey through 2017    <a name="_GoBack">successfully</a>, we can’t go it only. We can’t afford to
    do things our way. We need the Holy Spirit to lead the way. We need to keep
    in step with Him, so He can carry us along on this trip of faith.
</p>
<p class="article">
    Our theme for the Teens manual, ‘Dwelling in the Realm of the Holy Spirit’,
    provides a pertinent roadmap for us to chart the path our purpose takes us
    in the New Year. We can’t get on the road trying to figure out things by
    ourselves, or just go with the flow. That is not the way we roll! That is
    the way of the world. But we belong to a different realm. You, however, are
    not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed
    the Spirit of God lives in you… (Romans 8:9, NIV)
</p>
<p class="article">
    Yes indeed! We belong in the realm of the Spirit. As we explore the manual,
    prayerfully, faithfully and with great expectation, we are going to
    discover timely truths that will motivate us to walk with the Spirit, as we
    are being transformed from one level of glory to another, to be conformed
    to the image of Christ.
</p>
<p class="article">
    What do you need to take along with you, as you join this expedition with
    the Spirit? All that is required is an open mind and a willing heart.
</p>
<p class="article">
    Come with me on this adventure with the Spirit!
