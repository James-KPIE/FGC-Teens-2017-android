			<h2>Lesson 15</h2><h2>Christ Rides into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday)</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Matthew 21:1-11; Luke19:11-40
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
    From the house of the Lord we bless you.” - Psalm 118:26
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    Palm Sunday, otherwise known in the Bible as the Triumphal entry of Jesus
    Christ into Jerusalem Is the beginning Of His passion week.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    At the end of the lesson, the teens will be able to understand the purpose
    and meaning of Christ’s Kingship.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem marked the beginning of what is
    known to Christians as the ‘Passion Week’ – the week of His suffering,
    crucifixion and death for mankind. It was a precarious week for Jesus and
    his disciples. Everything happened so fast. What started out to be a pomp
    at the beginning of the week, dimmed into a weekend of a chain of
    inauspicious episodes that was to redefine the lives of the disciples, the
    history of the Jews and ultimately the destiny of humanity.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    It was the Passover week. Pilgrims flowed into Jerusalem from outlying
    towns and villages and from other parts of the known world for the
    celebration of the Passover feast. The feast was commemorative of the
    deliverance of the children of Israel out of Egypt. The Passover
    celebration re-enacted the story of freedom after more than four hundred
    years of Egyptian bondage. The recurring allusions to that deliverance in
    the Old Testament indicate that it was a source of hope for the nation's
    future redemption. Some Bible scholars suggest that close to 2 million
    people come into Jerusalem during the celebration. The city went agog with
    commercial activities. It was usually a time of buying and selling, as
    pilgrims brought in their wares, not only of such domestic goods as
    clothing, jewellery, and exotic ointments, but also of spices, herbs,
    condiments, wheat, fish, and wine used throughout the week-long
    festivities. Of utmost importance to pilgrims, however, was the buying of
    sheep and goats for sacrifice at the temple. This was the mood of the city
    when Jesus rode in.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Regal Entry of An Unlikely King</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As Jesus rode on a borrowed donkey from Bethphage on the Mount of Olives
    down into the Kidron valley, east into Jerusalem, excited pilgrims,
    especially from Galilee, cut palm branches and spread their clothes on the
    ground for him to ride on in a red carpet style. They shouted at the top of
    their voices: “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the
    name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” (v. 9) By this time, the whole
    city was in an uproar, asking “who can this be?” The cheering crowd
    answered, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.” (v.11)
    Jesus Christ well was known to the Galileans, but not too known to the
    Judean crowd. Until now Jesus had rather been quiet about his public
    identity. On this occasion, he chose to make his entry conspicuous to
    fulfil the prophecy of the coming Messiah in Zechariah 9:9-10. Apparently,
    the disciples and the Galilean pilgrims knew about the prophecy, hence
    their acclamation “Son of David!” indicating that they recognized Jesus'
    ancestry and were hopeful that he was the long awaited Messiah.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Unusual Reign of An Awaited King</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Whether the people were certain or not of Jesus’ messianic identity, they
    were very much on point to have proclaimed him King. For Christ was indeed
    the promised Messiah-King and not just the King of Israel, as the crowd had
    presumed, but the King of all. What kind of king rides on a lowly donkey
    and without his legion or at least a cohort? Indeed the kings of the earth
    would rather ride on horses and chariots accompanied by a large
    intimidating force, but Jesus was unlike any earthly king. His kingdom is
    not of this world (John 18:36). While earthly kings are pompous, ruthless
    and oppressed their subjects, unleashing war, terror and destruction in
    their wake, Jesus came as a gentle King, offering peace, salvation and
    liberty to humanity. Earthly kings conquer territories and forcefully
    impose their rule over vassal domains, but Christ conquer the hearts of
    people with His love. Secular kings surround themselves with fierce army of
    soldiers, distancing themselves from people in a demi-god style, Christ
    would rather identify with everyday people, demonstrating His connection
    with their humanity and plight. His kingship is marked service to humanity
    and especially to those who choose to come under His reign. He would care
    for them as their Shepherd.
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
    Although Jesus’ kingship is not in the same manner as earthly kings, His
    reign does have an impact on this world. Wherever there are people who have
    trusted Him and yielded to His reign, He is King. One day He shall return
    and establish a righteous kingdom on earth. Those who have subscribed to
    His rule by making Him their Lord and Savior, will participate fully in the
    reign of His kingdom, but those who reject Him now, will have themselves to
    blame as they would have to face judgement. Presently, all those who have
    accepted Jesus as their Lord and King, and are working out the ethics of
    His kingdom by their faith and works are already participating in the
    Kingdom.

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Why did Jesus have to ride into Jerusalem, rather than walk, as His
    usual practice as He went from place to place?
</p>
<p>
    2. What significance does Jesus’ style of kingship hold for those who want
    to be part of His kingdom?
</p>
<p>
    3. How should the events of Christ’s Passion Week, death and resurrection
    affect us as Christian teenagers?
