					<p>
    <strong>Lesson Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    J.K Rowling said, “It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more
    than our abilities.” One distinguishing factor between human and other
    creatures is the “will power”, ability to make choices. Life is all about
    making choices. All of life is defined by choice. In every generation, man
    struggles between two major choices; standing for God or taking a stand for
    the devil. Standing for God is a noble course. God wants His people to
    willingly choose Him.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In spite of God’s love for Israel, their sins still led them into captivity
    in Babylon. Israel had gone astray from the path that Yahweh had charted
    for them. Before the visitation of judgement, God sent Jeremiah to warn
    them to desist from their evil doing. God gave them opportunity for
    repentance, but they would not yield. They chose to displease God. They
    were conceited. They had false hope and false confidence, created in their
    hearts by their leaders.

<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Conceit of An Unjust Choice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    First, the people placed their confidence in the temple buildings. They
    were under the impression that the mere fact that the temple was located in
    Jerusalem would spare the city from captivity. They were wrong. God told
    them through Jeremiah that it would take genuine repentance to reverse the
    situation (Jer. 7:1-7). Repentance would mean not only true-hearted worship
    of the Lord, but also a change in how the people treated one another; that
    their dealings were to be just and honorable and without oppression.
    Second, they glossed over their obvious sins (Jer. 7:8-11). They were
    deluded into thinking that they could sin and go scot-free. After
    committing sin, they would go to the temple thinking that God would absolve
    them. That again was a fatal error, because God wasn’t going to spear them,
    no matter how they may try to patronize him. They are reminded of what
    happened in Shiloh, to their ancestors (Jer. 7:12). Shiloh is where the
    tabernacle had stood before the temple had been built at Jerusalem, and was
    at that time the center of the worship to Yahweh. The Ark of the Covenant
    was there.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Consequence of An Unjust Choice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It was at Shiloh that the Ark of the Covenant had been captured by the
    Philistines and the unfaithful people of Israel defeated (1 Sam. 4:10-11).
    They too had been mistaken to think that the physical presence of the ark
    would immune them from defeat. They were not faithful to the Lord in their
    conduct and service, they had a false confidence in the ark to give them
    victory in battle against the Philistines. Jeremiah warns that the fate of
    Jerusalem would be like that of Shiloh. Just as the ark did not save their
    ancestors from the onslaught of the Philistines, rather the ark was even
    captured, likewise, the temple will not save them from the captivity of the
    Babylonians, and even the temple will come to ruins, except they repent.
    And that was exactly what happened, because they failed to heed the warning
    of the prophet and turn from their wicked ways. For effectively 70 years
    Israel was in captivity as Jeremiah had prophesied (Jer. 25:8-12; 29:10).
    Their cities were devastated, their temple destroyed, their fortunes
    diminished, their honor denigrated and their children deprived.

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Conscience of a Just Choice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus the Great issued the decree for the release and return of the Jews,
    the repentant remnant of the people of God, to rebuild their devastated
    cities and the temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-4). The Jews began their
    return in batches. About 20 years after, Ezra led another batch of exiles
    to Jerusalem. Ezra had been born in captivity, but grew up to know God. He
    had the privilege to continue to work in the service of the king –
    Artaxerxes, but He chose to take a stand for a Godly cause. Ezra was a
    priest by birth, but his pedigree was not the basis for his devotion to
    God. There were others who were from the priestly lineage in his days, but
    Ezra chose to make a difference. Ezra was an effective servant of God
    because he had prepared himself to do God’s work. He was instrumental to
    restoring the people to the proper worship of Yahweh. First, he became a
    role model to the people, in his personal observance and obedience to God’s
    laws. Second, he challenged the people to take a persistent stand for God
    who has been faithful enough to bring them back with favor from exile. In
    Ezra’s day many of the people had broken God’s law and had married pagans.
    Ezra demanded that the people come out of these unscriptural marriages
    (Ezra, chapters 9 and 10). Ezra also organized the priesthood according to
    the teaching of the Scriptures.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Read Hosea 6:6. What is the significance this text to Israel’s false
    confidence in the temple buildings and their religious practices?
</p>
<p>
    2. It is often said that “history will repeat itself”. Should this have
    happened in the case of Israel, even after they were reminded of the error
    of Shiloh? (Justify your answer)
</p>
<p>
    3. Learning from Ezra, what choices should we be making, in order not to
    repeat errors of the past?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    In Ezra 7:10, we read: “For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of
    Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.”
    Unlike his ancestors who made an unjust choice in disobeying God’s
    principles, Ezra chose to make a difference in his generation. For him, the
    knowledge of God was a matter of the heart. His choice was motivated by his
    love for God and God’s people. Ezra came back from captivity expecting to
    find the people serving the Lord, but to his dismay he found the opposite.
    He chose to turn the tide of disobedience in the people. He mobilized the
    people to a spiritual reawakening and reshaped the community in accordance
    with the scriptures. Ezra’s life is a model for us in making a righteous
    choice in pleasing God in our lives.
