			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Acts 2:3; Matthew 3:16; Luke 3:22; John 7:38-39; Acts 2:1-2; and John 3:8.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
    Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and
    filled the whole house where they were sitting.” - Acts 2:1-2
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line</strong>
    : We can see the character of the Holy Spirit through wind, fire, water, a
    dove and oil.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective</strong>
    : In this lesson teens will see a connection between the characteristics of
    God, the Holy Spirit, and various symbols used in the Bible to describe Him
    and He does in the life of Christians.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Holy Spirit is the third person in the Godhead. He is a person just
    like the Father and the Son. He revealed Himself in the scripture in
    various ways. Every believer must have an encounter with the Holy Spirit in
    any of the ways in which He has used in various places to reveal Himself.
    Just as the Father revealed Himself to the people of old through various
    ways, and the Son also revealed Himself in the flesh, so also the Holy
    Spirit has ways of revealing Himself to believers.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Lord Jesus Christ introduced the person of the Holy Spirit to His
    disciples in the gospel of John 14. He introduced the Holy Spirit to them
    as the "Counselor" who will be with them forever. He told them that the
    Holy Spirit will live in them. He told them that the Holy Spirit will teach
    them all things and will remind them of everything he told them. On the day
    of the baptism of Jesus Christ at River Jordan, John saw the Spirit descend
    on Jesus Christ in bodily form like a dove. Jesus Christ further described
    the presence of the Holy Spirit like water or river that flows continuously
    in the person that receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit
    was also described as the oil which makes the work of grace upon any
    believer very easy.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as a Dove</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Holy Spirit is depicted in symbolic form as a dove. At the baptism of
    Jesus Christ by John the Baptist at river Jordan, the Holy Spirit was seen
    descending upon Jesus Christ in bodily form (Luke 3:22, John 1:32, Mark
    1:10, Matthew 3:16). The dove is an emblem of innocence or meekness and
    purity (Matt.10:6).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as Wind</strong>
</p>
<p>
    On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were all together in one accord. The
    Scripture recorded that there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
    mighty wind. Acts 2:2. The Spirit is likened to the wind in John 3:8. As it
    blows, so is the movement of the Holy Spirit. There’s a dynamism about the
    working of the Holy Spirit. You can contain or explain it, you just
    experience it. You can’t necessarily see where it came from or where it
    goes, but all of us can attest to times when God has come and dealt with
    us, and no human being knew how it happened. That is the way of the wind.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as River/Water</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jesus Christ pointed out that those who believe in Him, out of their belly
    shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:38-39). The Spirit is likened to
    an ever flowing water that any one that is thirsty can come and drink (Rev.
    22:1, 17).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as Fire</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Holy Spirit is likened to fire. The believer is admonished not to
    quench the fire of the Holy Spirit (1 Thess. 5:18). On the day of
    Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was depicted as cloven tongues of fire which sat
    on all in the upper room (Acts 2:3). Fire is a depiction of God’s presence,
    passion and purity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>V. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit as Oil</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Holy Spirit is likened to oil in the scripture. It is the enabling oil
    that makes ministration seem seamless. The presence of the Holy Spirit in
    any man is likened to anointing. Oil is the substance used during anointing
    processes. Oil makes the fire in a lamp to continue to glow and burn so is
    the presence of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life, it makes him to burn
    and glow for the Lord (Exo. 29:7, Acts 10:38).
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        The Holy Spirit is invisible, while our realm is visible. In each of
        the symbols discussed above, the Lord desires to move into our realm.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>
        The Holy Spirit comes to glorify Jesus—helping us to see Jesus more, to
        understand Jesus better, to respond to Jesus more obediently, and to
        love Jesus with a deeper heart of commitment, as He manifest through
        these symbols.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>
        So, as Jack Hayford writes, “the symbols of the Holy Spirit become
        essential to our gaining an understanding of what He’s like, not only
        in an objective way of analyzing truth, but also in the subjective way
        that He comes to penetrate our lives—ways in which the reality of the
        invisible penetrate the visible.”
    </li>
</ol>
