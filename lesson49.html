				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    It is very common in Africa for aged parents who are about to die to gather
    and pray for their children and give them some specific instructions they
    must follow after their demise. Children in this position don’t take
    lightly the word of their dying parents. While they may be sorrowful when
    their parents eventually depart, they will still be happy that their
    parents blessed them before dying. Certainly, such valedictory blessings
    pronounced by parents in that scenario lingers long in the lives of the
    children. In the same vein, in our text, Jesus, nearing His departure,
gathered His disciples together and committed them to the Father in Prayer.    <strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In the New Testament, Chapters 14-17 of the Gospel of John are known as the
    Farewell Discourse given by Jesus to his disciples, the night before He was
    crucified. The farewell message was more like the last words of a departing
    father to his children. This valedictory speech is classified into three
    categories. First, Jesus announces his departure to be with the Father—
    which invariably portends his suffering, crucifixion and resurrection and
    ascension. He however promises not to leave them comfortless. He will send
    the Holy Spirit to be with and guide them. Jesus commanded the disciples to
    love one another, emulating the unity and love in the Trinity. Second,
    Jesus illustrate the relationship the disciples have with Him and the
    Father, with the allegory of The Vine. The Vine again emphasizes the love
    among the disciples and their connection to Him, but Jesus then warns the
    disciples of upcoming persecutions, be He encourages them to find solace in
    Him, because, “I have overcome the world” ( John 16:33). In the final part
    of the discourse (John 17:1-26) Jesus prays for his followers and the
    coming Church. This is the longest prayer of Jesus in any of the gospels,
    and is known as the Farewell Prayer or the High Priestly Prayer. The key
    themes of the prayer are the glorification of the Father and the Son and
    petitions for the unity of the disciples through love.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer for Himself </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The time had come for Jesus to fulfill the purpose of God that was
    determined before the world was created (Rev 3:8) which is death by
    crucifixion for the salvation of humankind. All prophecy concerning the
    plan of redemption was now to be completed in Jesus (Lk 24:44). Therefore
    Jesus prayed to the father to glorify Him—the glorification of Jesus is
    linked to the threefold process of His crucifixion, resurrection and
    ascension. His act of obedience in surrendering to the cross allows for the
    completion of the work of the Christ beyond that event. He Himself had
    glorified the father by revealing the Father to disciples and by extension
    the Church (v. 6). Eternal life is made possible and given to all who know
    the Father through the Son. As Jesus is glorified, the lost world is
    redeemed and the Father is ultimately made known and glorified.
</p>

    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer for His Disciples </strong>
</p>
<p>
    From the prayer for Himself, Jesus moves to pray for His disciples. All
    this while Jesus had been with been with them as a shield against the world
    and the evil one. Now that he was leaving, He prayed the Father not to take
    them out of the world, because they would have to carry on with His work,
    but that they be preserved from the influences of sin and Satan so that
    they will not be polluted by the things of the world and so that they would
    be united as the Father and the Son (vv.11-12). Jesus further prayed that
    they would be sanctified (set apart) by the truth of God’s word (v.17). In
    being sanctified, the disciples would be able to live in obedience to God’s
    word, exude the character of Christ as they are shaped and directed by the
    Word of God. This way the disciples would fulfil the joy of Jesus in the
    sense that they would continue the redemptive work by spreading the Gospel
    to the world, invariably bring glory to Christ and the Father.
</p>

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Prayer for All Believers </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Having prayed for His immediate disciples, Jesus visualized those who were
    beyond His immediate company. He prayed for all those who would in the
    future become His disciples (v. 20), as the Gospel continues to spread.
    Interestingly, this is where you belong. Again, just like He did for the
    disciples, Jesus prays for the unity of all believers (v.21). The purpose
    of this unity is at least twofold: (1) that believers may be in the Father
    and the Son and (2) that the world may believe that the Father sent Jesus.
    Jesus prays that we may have the same oneness that He and the Father have.
    As we experience this God-like intimacy with one another, the world will
    believe that the Father sent the Son. In other words, Christian unity makes
    possible the expansion of God’s kingdom as more people are drawn to Christ.
    This again brings glory to Christ and God the Father. Rounding up, Jesus
    prays that believers would share in His glory (v. 24). Jesus actually
    securing the eternal destiny of believers. The grand design of Christ is,
    that all who believe should love and obey, persevere unto the end, and be
    eternally united to Him and the Father, in the kingdom of glory.

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Compare and contrast Jesus’ prayer points with some of our payer points
    in our homes/churches today.
</p>
<p>
    2. How do you feel that Jesus had you in mind and prayed for you while He
    was here on earth?
</p>
<p>
    3. How do you think you can be an answer to Jesus’ prayer?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Jesus’ prayer for us is a summary of purpose for our lives as
    Christians. We are a product and part of His redemptive work on earth, we
    are also partakers of His glory as we have share an eternal destiny with
    Him.
</p>
<p>
    2. We are to reflect the glory of the Son in our lives as we go about God’s
    ministry of restoration. We do this as we daily live our lives in obedience
    to His word and conformity to His character (Rom. 12:1-2} and by being
    God’s agents of restoration and transformation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    Jesus’ prayer is instructive of what should be the focus of our prayers.
    Our prayers should about moving the Kingdom forward. Prayers that move the
    Kingdom forward are those that focus on seeing: the lost saved and lives
    drawn to Christ, believers preserved as they grow in the truth of God’s
    word and Godlike unity, believers’ eternal destiny as they are secured to
    experience and enjoy His redemptive glory<strong>.</strong>
