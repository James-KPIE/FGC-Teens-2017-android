    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Malachi 3:1-12
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Ever since the time of your forefathers you have turned away from my
    decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,"
    says the Lord Almighty. "But you ask, 'How are we to return?' "Will a man
    rob God? Yet you rob me. "But you ask, 'How do we rob you?' "In tithes and
    offerings.” - Malachi 3:7-8
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    We must always be ready to right the wrongs when God searches us out.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will give opportunity to the teens to make things right with
    God.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Proverbs 14:34 says: “Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a
    reproach to any people.” The Bible tells us that our God and father is ever
    merciful. His mercy endures forever (Psa. 103:17; 106:1; 107:1; 117:2). He
    loves us and would not let the Devil destroy us and our eternal destiny.
    So, daily he beckons to us as a people and as a nation to come to Him and
    be saved from sin and death (Jn. 3:16; Rev. 3:19-20). He says to us to
    return to Him and He will return to us (Mal. 3:7; 1 Jn. 1:9). It is that
    simple. As Nigeria celebrates 57 years of political independence, the
    people must follow the path of righteousness and be freed from the effect
    of economic, social, and spiritual sins – the economic strangulation and
    cumulative hardship in the land is very enormous.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Prophet Malachi is believed to have proclaimed God’s message to the post
    exilic Jews between 430-420 BC. This was the season when the people were
    again experiencing adversity and spiritual decline. They had become
    cynical, doubting God’s love and promises. They questioned His justice and
    disbelieved that there was any profit in obeying His commands. As their
    faith dimmed, they became mechanical and insensitive in their worship
    observance, indifferent to the law’s requirements and guilty of all kinds
    of sins against the covenant. Malachi confronted both the priests and the
    people with the following prophetic summons:
</p>
<p>
    1. To repent of their sins and religious hypocrisy before God.
</p>
<p>
    2. To remove the obstacles of disobedience that were blocking the flow of
    God’s favour and blessing, and
</p>
<p>
    3. To return to the Lord and His covenant with sincere and obedient hearts.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Malachi Foretells God’s Visitation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In verses 1-5 of our text for this lesson, Prophet Malachi foretells of the
    visitation of God on the people. His visitation is a double-edge of both
    salvation and judgment. This double impact act would be fulfilled by the
    Messiah. The Messiah will come as a refiner and purifier of silver. He
    would purge and purify the priests as gold and silver, so that they would
    be sensitive in their worship observance and offer unto the Lord an
    offering in righteousness. This is the offering acceptable to God – in the
    past and at all times (Psa. 4:5; Rom. 6:13; 1 Pet. 2:5). Remember we are
    the present day priests of the Lord (1 Pet. 2:9). This message from Malachi
    spoke concerning Christ’s first and second coming. Christ has come offering
    salvation to all and sanctifying to all who receive Him (as individuals and
    nations). When He comes again, it would be to judge the world—both
    individuals and nations. He will purge out all the wicked in the land. Only
    the righteous will remain (cf. Isa. 1:25, 26; Ezek. 22:17-22).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Malachi Calls The People to Repentance</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In Malachi’s message, God reminds and rebukes the people that they had long
    strayed from His ordinances (laws) and had thus refused to keep them right
    from the days of their fathers. They had refused to take offering and
    tithes to God, no wonder they suffered lack, loss and agonizing
    deprivation. Then out of His great love for His people, He asks them to
    correct their ways and return to Him so He could restore them and bless
    them. His words in Malachi 3:7b, 12: “Return unto me, and I will return
    unto you, saith the Lord of hosts.” “And all nations shall call you
    blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.” What
    God says to Israel, He says to His Church and to us teenagers. Let us
    boldly right all wrongs as God searches us out through His Spirit in us.
    That is our only means to restoration and lasting blessings. Then all
    nations shall call us blessed and we shall be a delightsome people to God’s
    glory.

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Teenagers as succeeding generations of every nation, must respond
    swiftly to the plea to return to God, especially in the face the growing
    decadence in the world.
</p>
<p>
    2. Christian teenagers must see themselves messengers of God, sent to
    prepare the world for the coming of Christ, in a lifestyle of obedience to
    God, in evangelizing and in prayers for the nation and non-Christians.
</p>
<p>
    3. Our memory verse is Malachi 3:7 “Even from the day of your fathers ye
    are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me,
    and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts.”
