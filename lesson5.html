    <strong>Text:</strong>
    John 16: 5-7; 14:16-18; Acts1:3-5
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless
    I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him
    to you.” - John 16:7
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    The Holy Spirit enables us to do greater things.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to depend on the Holy Spirit and therefore
    be ready to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit so they can be powerful
    and stable Christians.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    When Jesus was going away, He told His disciples that very soon He wouldn’t
    be with them anymore. And of course that made them very sad. But then He
    told them something very astounding that settled their mind. He told them
    that it was better for them if He went away, because, if He did, He would
    send “the Comforter” to be with them. Jesus would not leave them alone.
    They would not become orphans.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The KJV refers to the Holy Spirit as the Comforter; whereas, the NIV
    translation calls Him Counselor (John 14:16-18). Whether we call Him
    Comforter or Counselor, He is the Spirit of God that will help the
    Christian to live a consistent and empowered life. He will help us to
    witness for Christ (Acts 1:8). When Jesus was leaving He knew that we would
    need the Holy Spirit to accomplish all that He had for us to do. His final
    words before His ascension into heaven must have continued to ring in His
    disciples ears (Acts 1:8). So, the promise of the Father in Joel 2 should
    be put into consideration here. Christ not only proposes such things to
    them as were the matter of their comfort, but here promises to send the
Spirit, whose office it should be to be their Comforter, to    <em>impress</em> these things upon them.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Foundations to This Promise </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Keeping the commandments of Christ is here put for the practice of
    godliness in general, and for the faithful and diligent discharge of their
    office as apostles in particular.
</p>
<p>
    A. When Christ is comforting them, He bids them to keep His commandments.
    We must not expect comfort except in the way of duty.
</p>
<p>
    B. When they were in His care, they were to do nothing much, now that their
    Master was leaving them, what would become of them now? He bids them to
    keep His commandments, and then nothing could come in between them.
</p>
<p>
    C. When they were showing their love to Christ by grieving to think of His
    departure, and the sorrow which filled their hearts upon the foresight of
    that, He told them, if they would show their love to Him, it must be by
    their conscientious care to perform their trust, and by a universal
    obedience to His commands which is better than sacrifice and better than
    their tears.
</p>
<p>
    D. When Christ had given them precious promises, of the answer to their
    prayers and the coming of the Comforter, He lays down the principle of
    obedience to His commandments. Christ will not be an advocate for anyone
    except those who follow His counsel.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Promise is with Great and Unspeakable Blessing to Them</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. It is promised that they shall have another Comforter. This is the great
    New Testament promise (Acts 1:4), as that of the Messiah was of the Old
    Testament. The blessing promised is as follows: I John 2
</p>
<p>
    1. You shall have another Advocate.
</p>
<p>
    2. You shall have another Master or Teacher, another Exhorter.
</p>
<p>
    3. Another Comforter. Christ comforted His disciples when He was with them,
    and now that He was leaving them in their greatest need He promises them
    another.
</p>
<p>
    B. The giver of this blessing is the Father<em> </em>(John 15:26).
</p>
<p>
    C. This blessing is procured by the intercession of the Lord Jesus.
</p>
<p>
    D. The continuance of this blessing depends on obedience.
</p>
<p>
    E. This Comforter is the Spirit of truth, whom you know<em>.</em> John
    14:16,17.
</p>
<p>
    1. The Comforter promised is <em>the Spirit</em>, one who should do His
    work in a spiritual way and manner, inwardly and invisibly, by working on
    men’s spirits.
</p>
<p>
    2. “He is the Spirit of truth.” He will be true to you, and to His
undertaking for you, which He will perform to the utmost. He will    <em>teach you the truth</em>, will enlighten your minds with the knowledge
    of it, will strengthen and confirm your belief of it, and will increase
    your love to it.
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Spirit will Baptize The Disciples </strong>
</p>
<p>
    As Jesus promised His disciples, the Holy Spirit came upon them in the
    Upper Room and they all were baptized with the initial evidence of speaking
    in tongues. Every person who puts his or her trust in Jesus is baptized
    with the Holy Spirit. When God gave His Holy Spirit to live inside the
    believers (the spiritual reality) God gave believers the power to do His
    perfect will. This is why the Holy Spirit was sent.<u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Since Jesus rose from the dead, why didn’t He just stay here on the
    Earth?
</p>
<p>
    2. Why do I need a Comforter?
</p>
<p>
    3. If the Holy Spirit is still around, why aren’t things better than they
    are?
</p>
