				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Seals are semiaquatic marine mammals. They have four flippers, so are in a
    category of animals known as pinnipedia which means 'fin-footed. Although
    they are warm-blooded, seals are well adapted for living in the sea. They
    can dive to great depths for long periods of time in search of prey, their
    bodies are streamlined to move efficiently in water, and they have blubber
    to protect them against the cold. Seals spend some time out of the sea.
    They give birth on land and they shed their skin annually on land. Seals
    can also move about on land quite tolerably, although rather clumsily. On
    land, a seal moves with struggle. It forces it weight onto its chest, and
    then stretches its back to swing its rear end forward. It is an inefficient
    way to move, and has made them vulnerable to hunting by humans. On ice,
    however, seals are far more light-footed. They can move faster than a human
    can run, and as long as they are not on land, they are no easy prey for any
    hunter. What has this info about seals got to do with today’s lesson? Find
    out!<strong></strong>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Last week we learnt that the Holy Spirit lives in us and what that means.
    Today we are going even further to learn that we must walk in the Spirit.
    Walking suggests that there is a path to go through. Indeed when we become
    born again, we begin a new path of life with the Holy Spirit. Our
    relationship with the Holy Spirit obliges us to go along with him as he
    carries us along that path (Rom 8:14). Just like the seal, a warm blooded
    mammal that is adapted to live in the sea, though we are flesh and blood,
    when we become born of the Spirit, we become adapted to live by the Spirit
    (walk in the Spirit, walk the way of the Spirit). Our relationship with
    Holy Spirit inclines us to keep in step with the Spirit’s dictates (v 25).
    It means we bring ourselves under the influence of the Spirit. Walking in
    the Spirit is a lifestyle. It is an everyday thing.

<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Imperative of Walking In The Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Walking in the Spirit is an essential, it is not an option. The best bet
    for the seal’s survival is at the sea- being at sea for seal is not an
    option. Similarly, because we are God’s children and the Spirit lives in
    us, we must be conscious, willing and deliberate in obeying the directives
    of the Spirit. Remember we belong to God and as such we can no more do as
    we please. Walking in the Spirit is our responsibility. You don’t ask
    somebody else to help you walk in the Spirit for you. It is your
    responsibility. You yield to the guidance of the Holy Spirit as he leads
    you, because that is part of what makes you a child of God (Rom 8:14).
    Because we have been adopted into God’s family, we are adapted into the
    lifestyle of the Spirit. We are wired to walk in the Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Implication of Walking In The Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As long as the seal is at sea, it cannot be ensnared by its predator.
    Likewise, we learn from our text that as long as we live by (walk in) the
    Spirit, we will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature (v. 16). The
    sinful nature, otherwise called the flesh, is the predator of your soul,
    always wanting to ensnare you by appealing to your sensuality, to act
    contrary to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. However, when in loving
    obedience we listen to and do what the Spirit says, our lives begin to show
    forth the fruit of the Spirit, which is love, joy, peace, patience,
    kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (vv.22-23).
    These are the characteristics of the one who walks in the Spirit. That way
    we are invulnerable to the snare of the sinful nature and our identity as
    children of God is not smeared.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Can you identify with real life or hypothetical examples some ways in
    which the sinful nature tries to ensnare our soul?
</p>
<p>
    2. Read Galatians 5:19- 21 in the Message translation and try to relate
    with some of the lifestyles motivated by the sinful nature.
</p>
<p>
    3. In what ways do think the lifestyles of the Spirit (enumerated in
    vv.22-23) immune us to the lifestyles of the sinful nature?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    Remember as many as are led (controlled, influenced) by the Spirit are the
    Children of God. Part of what makes you a child of God is your obedience to
    the guidance of the Holy Spirit. You cannot stoop so low to allow yourself
    be ensnared by the sensuality and overpowered by the lust of the sinful
    nature—that is not you. You are wired to walk in in the Spirit. “…you are
    not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if
    you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do
    not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)”
    Rom. 8:9.
