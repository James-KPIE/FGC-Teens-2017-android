				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>We are all born with unique abilities in life. This uniqueness is what
    differentiates from one another. Similarly, as Christians, we are uniquely
    and differently endowed with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. However, the
    diversity of our endowment is meant to be complementary and not
    competitive. It is supposed build unity among us, as believers and to be
    divide us.</strong>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In 1 Corinthians 12, Apostle Paul revealed the gifts of the Holy Spirit
    that has been released upon the church for the purpose of fulfilling the
    work of Christ on earth. Paul observed that there can be diversities of
    gifts, differences in administrations and diversities of operations but all
    these are controlled by the same Holy Spirit, the same Lord and the same
    God. In our text Paul highlights nine gifts. The nine are further
    categorized under three triads, namely: The Revelational Gifts, The Power
    Gifts and The Vocal Gifts.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Revelational Gifts</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The revelational gifts are special abilities given to the believer to
    exercise supernatural knowledge, they are Wisdom, Knowledge and Discernment
    of spirits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The word of wisdom</strong>
    comes into operation at any crucial moment when there is a word to be
    released to resolve any unclear issue facing the church (1Corinthians 12:8,
    2Chronicles 1:11). King Solomon was blessed with the gift of the word of
    wisdom and in many instances he used the gift to resolve disputes that were
    brought to him (1 Kings 3:24-28, 4:29).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The word of knowledge</strong>
    is the ability to discover, analyze, and systematize truth for the benefit
    of others. With this gift, one speaks with understanding and penetration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>The discernment of spirits</strong>
    (note that it is not the spirit of discernment as popularly but wrongly
    designated) is the ability to discern the type of spirit in operation in
    any gathering or circumstance is a special gift. There are so many spirits
    in the world that are competing to get the attention of the church. When
    the identity of the spirit in operation is revealed, it puts to rest any
    uncertainty about which spirit is in operation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Power Gifts</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The power gifts are abilities to exercise and accomplish supernatural acts.
    They include: Faith, Healings, and Miracles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Faith </strong>
    is the ability to demonstrate strong faith in the midst of strong
    uncertainty. . This type of faith is different from the one available to
    every believer. It is a special ability to believe God for the most
    impossible thing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The gifts of healings </strong>
    is the ability to be able to demonstrate healings in various dimensions
    upon the church. There are different kinds of sickness and diseases and
    there are different kinds of healings (1 Cor. 12:9; Acts 3:6-8; 6:5).
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>The working of miracles confer</strong>
    on the individual the ability to accomplish extraordinary or supernatural
    acts that will lead to the winning of more souls to the Lord Jesus Christ
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Vocal Gifts</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The vocal gifts are gifts of supernatural utterance. The Holy enables the
    believer to speak the mind of God on issues pertinent to the body of
    Christ. They are Prophesy, Tongues, and Interpretation.
</p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
    <li>
        <strong>The gift of prophesy</strong>
        is the ability to receive and proclaim a message from God. This could
        involve the foretelling of future events, though its primary purpose as
        seen in 1 Corinthians 14:3 is forth telling: one who prophesies speaks
        to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and consolation.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="A">
    <li>
        <strong>Divers kinds of tongues</strong>
        is the ability to receive and impart a spiritual message in a language
        the recipient never learned. For other members of the body to be
        edified, this message must be interpreted either by the recipient (1
        Cor. 14:13) or by another person with the gift of interpretation (1
        Cor. 14:26-28).
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="A">
    <li>
        <strong>Interpretation of tongues</strong>
        (1 Cor. 12:10, 30; 14:5, 13, 26-28)--The ability to translate into the
        understandable language a message publicly uttered in a tongue. This
        gift may be combined with the gift of tongues (1 Cor. 14:13), or it can
        operate separately (1 Cor. 14:26-28).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
						<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Every believer has the opportunity of receiving one or more of the
        gifts of Holy Spirit, but not all. The believer may desire and request
        for a gift, but it is prerogative of the Holy Spirit to give what to
        who.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>
        The Holy Spirit enables the manifestation of each gifts in the life of
        the believer for the benefit of the church.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>
        The gifts are not for personal gratification and shouldn’t lead to
        pride or conceit in recipient.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
    <li>
        No one gift is higher than the other and they are not mutually
        exclusive, the gifts must work together to build the church of Christ.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
    <li>
        It is important that every Christian discover and develop the spiritual
        gifts that have been bestowed on him or her by God (2 Timothy 1:6), for
        the purpose fulfillment, edifying the church and glorifying God.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
    <li>
        Manifestation of any gifts does not measure spirituality or spiritual
        maturity. It is the manifestation the fruit of the Spirit that
        determines the spirituality of the believer.
    </li>
</ol>
