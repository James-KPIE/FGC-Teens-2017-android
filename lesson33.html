				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The devil has proved to be the archenemy of Christians and the church of
    Jesus Christ. The early church faced different levels of persecution. There
    was a cold hearted enmity in Herod and the Jews against the church. This
    kind of bitterness is very much current in the world today including our
    immediate society. Christians and missionaries are facing serious
    persecutions all over the world. Islamic fundamentalists are committing
    professing Christians to death. Boko Haram in the North East Nigeria is a
    clear example. However, the scripture declared, “Who shall separate us from
    the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
    famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? … Yet in all these things we are
    more than conquerors through Him who loved us” (Rom 8:35-37).
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Jews were greatly opposed to the disciples of Jesus. Herod who was the
    Roman ruler at the time was Agrippa I. He was popular with the Jews for he
    was partly Jewish, being of Hasmonean descent. His kingdom covered
    basically the same area as that of his grandfather Herod the Great. He was
    doing everything possible to get the favour of the Jews. So, he found it
    politically expedient to arrest Christians. He executed James, the brother
    of John. He went further to arrest Peter to gain favour from the Jews.
    Herod Agrippa I died in A.D. 44. His son, Herod Agrippa II, was king of
    Judea from A.D. 50-70. Paul was on trial before Agrippa II and his sister
    Bernice (Acts 25:13-26:32).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Violence Against The Church <em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The heavy persecution against the early church led to the execution of
    Apostle James. When King Herod saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he
    also arrested Apostle Peter during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This
    incident clearly indicates that the church was an “identifiable group"
    which had become hated and despised by the Jews. Herod intended to bring
    out Peter for public trial after the Passover. Herod made certain that
    Peter's imprisonment was secure by handing him over to be guarded by four
    squads of four soldiers each!
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Miraculous Escape of Peter </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The church gathered and was earnestly praying to God for him. Peter’s faith
    in the Lord was so strong that he was sound asleep the night before his
    trial (cf. 1 Pet. 2:23; 5:7). He did not fear for his life because Christ
    had said he would keep His own (John 21:18). An angel appeared in the
    prison and told him to get dressed and follow him out of the prison.
    Supernaturally, God caused the chains to fall off his wrists, kept the
    guards asleep, and opened the iron gate. When Peter came to himself, braced
    by the night air, he acknowledged God's deliverance for him from Herod and
    the Jews.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Brethren Received Peter </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The unexpected arrival of Peter at John Mark's home is filled with humour
    and human interest. The servant girl, Rhoda, who answered Peter's knock
    recognized his voice. Though the saints were praying earnestly for Peter's
    release, they did not expect an answer so soon! When Rhoda insisted, ‘Peter
    is at the door!’ They replied, ‘You're out of your mind. It must be his
    angel.’ When they saw Peter, they were astonished. After making himself
    known to the brothers, Peter left for another place. After an investigation
    of Peter's escape, Herod cross-examined the guards and ruthlessly ordered
    their executions. Herod must have lost about 16 guards by his actions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>Violent Death Of Herod </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tyre and Sidon were in Herod's dominion and for some reasons had incurred
    his wrath. Because these cities depended on Galilee for sustenance, they
    desired to make peace with Herod Agrippa. On the appointed day when Herod
    was delivering a speech, the people honoured him as a god, and the Lord God
    judged him with death. This was in A.D. 44. After Herod's death, Felix and
    Festus, successively, were the governors of Judea. After the death of Herod
    Agrippa the Word of God continued to increase and spread. In spite of
    opposition and persecution the Lord sovereignly prospered the work of His
    church.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. The Church of Jesus Christ has been a focus for satanic persecution.
    Discuss.
</p>
<p>
    2. Have you ever faced persecution in your Christian race? Narrate your
    experience.
</p>
<p>
    3. What is the significance of Peter’s miraculous escape from the
    conspiracy of Herod and the Jewish people?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. The persecution against the early church led to the arrest of Apostle
    Peter by King Herod who desired to please the Jews. While Apostle Peter was
    in prison, the angel of God showed up and rescued him.
</p>
<p>
    2. Regardless of whatever we might pass through in the course of preaching
    the Gospel and in our Christian race, God is ever ready to save and deliver
    us. We should remember the words of Jesus, “These things I have spoken unto
    you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
    tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).
    The Master concluded, “…lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
    world. Amen” (Matt 28:20).
</p>
<p>
    3. We must remember in prayer other Christians who are being persecuted in
    the north of Nigeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, China and other places.
    Pray for strength and preservation and they keep raising the banner for
    Christ.
