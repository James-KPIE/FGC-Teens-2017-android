				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (1913-2005) was an African American female
    activist who in 1955 refused to continue to accept the status quo of
    racism. She refused to give up her seat for a white commuter. This led to
    her arrest, she lost her job and even got death threats but she refused to
    let go of her conviction, she stood for equal rights for all men. Parks
    played an important role in raising international awareness of the plight
    of African Americans and the civil rights struggle. Parks doggedness and
    that of other African Americans like Martin Luther King Junior who believed
    in equality has become a reality. Today in America, an African American is
    the president. The story of Rosa Parks resonates with the story of Stephen
    in our text, as they both stuck to their convictions in the face of
    life-threatening oppositions.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    At the time of Stephen’s accusation, Christianity was a new religion in
    town, bringing in a new perception to the religious beliefs (Judaism) that
    they have tenaciously held on to for so long. It was natural for them to
    have refuted this new way of life as human nature fights what it does not
    understand. Human nature fights truth. But the custodians of the truth must
    be willing to present it knowing fully well that truth always prevail over
    lies. It is said that truth is bitter, nevertheless, it must be told
    especially, a life changing truth like the gospel of Christ that has the
    power to transform lives.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Stephen’s Accusation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are three things the Jews hold in high esteem; their religion
    (Judaism), their land and their temple<strong>.</strong> The accusers of
    Stephen brilliantly set him up against the Jewish religious ruling council.
    Stephen was falsely accused of making derogatory statements against the
    temple, the land and the laws of Moses; these were serious crimes before
    the Jewish rulers who constituted the highest religious and political
    council of their day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Stephen’s Argument</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Stephen in response to the accusation rhetorically and logically presented
    the gospel to his audience. He started from how God called Abraham, the
    father of faith up until Jesus Christ. He systematically started with what
    the people already knew to the new faith in Christ they are now violently
    opposing. In the face of opposition, Stephen’s sound knowledge of the
    scriptures (Old Testament as was available to them then) came into bear.
    Biblical history says out of the 40 Old Testament references used in the
    Book of Acts, Stephen used 15 in this speech. His argument exposed their
    religiosity and presented the truth which they ignorantly refuted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Do you think the Christian faith is worth dying for? (give a good reason
    for your answer)
</p>
<p>
    2. In this 21<sup>st</sup> Century, what are the likely oppositions to the
    Gospel?
</p>
<p>
    3. How then should Christians prepare for and engage opposition?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    In Stephen’s defence against his accusers, he narrated how Joseph’s
    conviction about God’s plan for his life attracted his brother’s hatred,
    envy and anger. They sold him into slavery in order to silence the truth
    about his future but Joseph held on to his faith in God in spite of
    slavery, and even in the prison experience, he never denied God. God showed
    up for him as he eventually became the prime minister of the land of Egypt.
    Oppositions can come either from within (the home front) or from outside,
    the sound knowledge of God’s words and promises coupled with strong
    convictions avail one the boldness to remain firm as demonstrated in the
    lives of Stephen and even Joseph who was sold into slavery as a teenager.
    Your knowledge and understanding of God’s word and your commitment to it is
    essential in standing firm against any opposition to your faith.
