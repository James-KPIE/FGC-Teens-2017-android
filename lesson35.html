				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Why do Christians worship on Sunday? Why do we have some other church
    denominations who worship on Saturday? Who is right and who is wrong? What
    happens to Christians in countries where Sunday is not a public holiday—
    when do they gather for worship? Would they be violating any scriptural
    principle if they worship on any other day apart from Sunday? Have you ever
    thought along these lines? What kind of answers or ideas are flickering
    through your mind? Let’s find out if your thoughts kind find any congruence
    with today’s lesson.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The Sabbath is the practice of observing one day in seven, usually the
    seventh day of the week, as a time for rest and worship. This practice
    apparently originated in creation, because God created the universe in six
    days and rested on the seventh (Gen 2: 2-3). It was based on this
    understanding that Moses instituted the observance of the Sabbath, as the
    fourth commandment, when he presented the Ten Commandments to the children
    of Israel (vv.8-11). In keeping the Sabbath holy, Israelites were to
    abstain from all forms of work. Anyone who flouted this law risked the
    penalty of death (Ex. 31:15). Next to the ritual of circumcision, the
    observance of the Sabbath became the distinctive mark of the Jewish race up
until the first century A.D during the advent of Christ and even beyond it.    <strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Significance Of The Sabbath </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    A few significant points need to be clarified in view of the Mosaic
    institution of the Sabbath. This may help us in appreciating, what the
    Sabbath signifies for the Jews and how we may as Christians relate to it
    today.
</p>
<p>
    A. Importantly, it should be noted that the fourth commandment wasn’t given
    in isolation, but it was given in relationship to the preceding three,
    those which bear upon Israel’s relationship to God, forbidding the worship
    of other gods and the use of idols (Ex 20:1-5). The commandment makes a
    significant contribution to the Israel’s (true) worship of God. God was
    teaching His people more about worship, than about observance of a
    particular day.
</p>
<p>
    B. The observance of the Sabbath was declared to be the sign of the Mosaic
    Covenant between God and His chosen people Israel (30:13). It was also a
    reminder of how God delivered them from slavery in Egypt (Deut. 5:12-15).
    Their redemption and exodus was a kind of Sabbath from the toil of bondage.
    God’s covenant with His people and their redemption was key to the Sabbath.
</p>
<p>
    C. Since Sabbath observance was the sign of the covenant, observing the
    Sabbath was the Israelites’ pledge to keep the whole Law. To break this
    commandment was to reject all of the Law. This made obedience to the law
    very important, even more important with the death penalty prescribed for
    its violation. Obedience was a significant element of the Sabbath.
</p>
<p>
    D. The commandment wasn’t just a requirement to “keep the Sabbath,” but
    more of an instruction to “keep the Sabbath holy” (20:8). Keeping the
    Sabbath involves much more than abstinence from labour, it requires the
    acknowledgment of the sacredness, the sanctity, of this day because of
    God’s deeds and declaration. The words and works of a Holy God was supposed
    to be the focus of the people in keeping the Sabbath, not just the day.
</p>
<p>
    E. The purpose of Israel’s Sabbath observance was to teach them about
    sanctification (31:13). Just as God had set the seventh day apart from the
    other six at creation, so He had set Israel apart by His divine calling and
    their deliverance from slavery. In keeping the Sabbath holy, the Jews were
    then to keep themselves holy (set apart). The keeping of the Sabbath thus
    became an essential lesson in sanctification.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Sabbath and The Lord’s Day</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Early Christians chose to adopt the first day of the week, Sunday, for
    worship, undoubtedly because Christ rose on that day. Designated as the
    Lord’s Day, Sunday became a day of worship and the celebration of the
    Resurrection and fellowship with one another and with the risen Christ whom
    Christians trust as Saviour and worship as God. Although some Christian
    denominations still observe the Sabbath (Saturday) as a day of worship, the
    Christian community as a whole does not keep the Sabbath. There is often
    controversies between those who observe Saturday and those who adopt Sunday
    as the day of worship, just as it was the case, from inception, between
    early Christians who gather on Sundays and adherents of Judaism, who insist
    that worship must be on Sabbath, in the synagogues. Christians continue to
    uphold Sunday as the Lord’s Day, because there are no commandments or
    exhortations, explicitly or implicitly, in the New Testament in support of
    observing Sabbath. Rather, the early church gathered on the first day of
    the week in celebration and remembrance of the resurrection. Christians
    also insist on not keeping the Sabbath because it was a part of the old
    covenant, legal requirements of the Law, and according to the New Testament
    Christians today are not under such legal requirements like circumcision,
    ceremonial washings, animal sacrifices and the rest. Instead, under the new
    covenant (2 Cor. 3:6) New Testament believers are to produce the
    righteousness of the Law, the character of Christ, through the Spirit (Rom.
    6:14; 8:1-4; 2 Cor. 3:4-18; Gal. 3-5).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Supremacy of Christ Over Sabbath</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Although Jesus observed the Sabbath by attending the synagogue meetings,
    His teachings and some of His actions, showed there was no need to
    overemphasise its observance. Once, He told off the Pharisees, whose
    interpretation of the Sabbath law, had then neutralized its significance.
    They had accused His disciples of plucking corn, from a corn plantation on
    a Sabbath. Jesus answered them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man
    for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). In Matthew’s rendering of the same incident,
    Jesus said, “For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” Christ being God
    and the mediator of the New Covenant is supreme over the Sabbath. (Matt
    12:8) At another time, when the Pharisees questioned Jesus for healing a
    man’s withered hand on a Sabbath, He answered them with a question, “Which
    is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to
    kill?” (Mark 3:4) They couldn’t answer Him. Jesus and His disciples were
    not guilty of violating any scriptural law governing the Sabbath, but only
    conflicted with the Pharisees’ interpretation of the law. Rather than
    uphold the significance of the Sabbath law, they overemphasised its
    trivialities, making it burdensome for the people to observe. This was what
    Christ came to change. What was the point hallowing a day, without
    hallowing the Lord of the day. Christ is the Lord of not just the Sabbath,
    but the Lord of every other day. Paul, reinforced the supremacy and the
    sufficiency of Christ over the Sabbath, when he urged the Colossians to
    "let no one pass judgment on you ... with regard to a festival or a new
    moon or a Sabbath…” (Col 2:16) This text along with implicit references to
    the Sabbath in Rom 14:5 and Gal 4:10, and some other texts, underscore New
    Testament teaching on the observance of the Sabbath or any other day at
    that.

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What key themes can you identify from the significance of the Sabbath
    and what are their implications today?
</p>
<p>
    2. Christ is the Lord of not just the Sabbath, but the Lord of every other
    day: what is the implication of this statement?
</p>
<p>
    3. In what way is Christ supreme over the Sabbath?

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    Jesus told the Samaritan woman, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when
    you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem…Yet a
    time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the
    Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father
    seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in
    truth.” (John 4:21-24). The emphasis on worship, shouldn’t be whether it
    should be on a Sunday or a Saturday; it shouldn’t be whether it should be
    done in the temple or in the synagogue. True worship demands true
    worshipers, who are sincere and whose hearts are connected to God. When
    such people gather to worship, wherever they choose to gather, whichever
    day they choose to gather, would be hallowed, because God would be present.
    Are you a true worshiper?
