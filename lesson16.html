				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    An atheistic lawyer named Frank Morrison attempted a research on Jesus’
    resurrection with the intention to write a book disproving it. Instead, his
    discovery convinced him that it had happened. The experience led to his
conversion and subsequently he wrote the book,    <em>Who Moved The Stone?</em>, proving that Jesus’ resurrection actually
    took place. Cynics like Morrison had always existed from the first century
    when Jesus’ resurrection took place.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    To the Jewish leaders, the Resurrection story was a mere fraud concocted by
    Jesus to immortalize Himself in the minds of His disciples. They chose to
    be blind to the prediction concerning this event (Psalm.16:10) and
    staunchly vowed to foil any attempt by anyone to take Christ’s body from
    the tomb and announce to the people that he had risen. They rolled a huge
    stone over the entrance to the tomb and positioned soldiers to take down
    anyone who would approach the tomb to take the body (Matt. 27:62-66). It
    did not enter into their minds that God’s redemptive work is a divine
    arrangement unstoppable by any man and even the devil. It was not just the
    Pharisees and Jewish authority that disbelieved the possible resurrection
    of Jesus Christ on the third day after his death and burial. Even his own
    disciples – all of them, Peter inclusive, did not believe the resurrection
    story when the women who had gone to the tomb early Sunday morning,
    returned to disclose this historic event. They only believed when they saw
    the risen Jesus with their own eyes.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Love in Despair</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James and Salome (women who followed
    Jesus) prepared sweet spices and went early on Sunday morning (the third
    day, counting from Friday when he died) to anoint his body. This was a
    customary practice that should have been done before burial. However
    because the body of Christ was brought down from the cross late Friday and
    the next day being Sabbath, the anointing had to be postponed. It is
    significant that the women brought spices for the anointing, as only the
    bodies of dignitaries like kings enjoyed such luxury. This was an
    indication of how much the women esteemed and loved Jesus. However, their
    action on this particular Sunday morning was a glaring display of either
    ignorance, forgetfulness or lack of understanding of what Jesus had said
    about his suffering in the hands of the Jewish religious rulers, and his
    death and resurrection on the third day (Matt. 16:21; 17:23; Mark. 8:31;
    9:31; Luke. 9:22). Although the women may have loved Jesus and were loyal
    to him even in death, it appeared they did not believe his resurrection
    ‘sermon’. No doubt, any hope that Christ’s teaching ignited in them died
    with his death. ‘It is all over’ they seemed to have concluded.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Hope in Dismay</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As they approached the tomb in which Jesus was buried, the women wondered,
    who would help them in rolling away the stone that covered the tomb. It
    would take more than 20 hefty men to roll away the stone. But thank
    goodness, when they got there, the stone had been rolled back. They were
    however caught by surprise when they got into the tomb and the body of
    Jesus wasn’t there. Instead, a young man clad in white (definitely an
    angel) told them not to be afraid and gave them the news that sent them
    into a deeper state of shock, “He has risen! He is not here.” They must
    have gone blank for a moment, trying to process what they just heard and
    possibly may have barely heard the angel tell them to go and announce the
    big news to the other disciples. With a mixture of fear and perplexity,
    they hurried out of the place, saying nothing to anyone. No doubt, a ray of
    hope was rising even in their bemusement. “He is risen.” That today would
    sound like a major news headline on the dailies or news channel, or the
    title of a new movie showing at the cinemas. Indeed, more than a news
    headline or a movie title, those three words were the game changer for the
    Christian faith.

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    It is the physical resurrection of Christ that sets apart Christianity from
    all other religions. Without Jesus’ resurrection, He would only remain in
    our minds as another legend in history. We wouldn’t be talking about
    salvation or the hope of resurrection in the last day. Jesus’ resurrection
    makes Him the author and finisher of faith (Heb. 12:2). His resurrection is
    also the foundation of all other resurrections. This makes the Christian
    faith a living faith and not a mythical one. Christ’s resurrection was part
    of the full package of redemption that God worked for humankind before the
    foundation of the earth (1.Peter.1:19-21). If the package was short of
    resurrection, but merely ended with the death of Christ, then humankind
    would have been doomed forever. All hope of humanity’s regeneration and
    reconciliation with God would have been lost. The confession of our faith
    (Rom 10:9) and the New Life we now share with Christ is based on Jesus’
    resurrection (Col 3:1).

    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1 Why was it necessary that Jesus Christ should resurrect from the dead?
</p>
<p>
    2 What does Christ’s resurrection assure us of? (Acts17:31; Jn.5:28-29).
</p>
<p>
    3 What give us access to share in the resurrected life of Jesus? (Col.
    2:12)
