				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    God’s word is all the treasure that we ever need to lead our lives
    successfully. Our memory verse for this lesson, which is one of the Ten
    Commandments God gave to His chosen people enjoins us to honour our
    parents, so that our lives may not be cut short abruptly, but be prolonged
    unto good old age. This is a lesson every teenager must take heed of, to
    safeguard his or her life.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The children of Israel had just been freed by God from oppression and
    slavery in Egypt. They had miraculously crossed the Red Sea on dry land and
    were in the wilderness travelling towards Canaan, the land of promise. God
    decided to give to them guiding principles – these are the Ten Commandments
    – to guide their conduct in their relationship with God; with one another
    and with the strangers on the way and in the land of Canaan. The Ten
    Commandments summarized God’s moral law for Israel and described their
    obligations both to Him and to others. Jesus Christ and the apostles
    affirmed that the commandments are an expression of God’s holy will and
    thus remain obligatory for New Testament believers (Matt.22:37-39;
    Mk.12:28-34; Lk.10:27; Rom.13:9-10; Gal.5:14).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>God Commands Honour to Mothers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As we see in our texts for this lesson, honouring our mothers/parents is
    God’s command to His children. Just as it was important for the children of
    Israel to obey this commandment, so it is to us, to obey this commandment
    today. The Bible teaches that we are to give due care, regard, and
    attention to our parents and be helpful to them. Are there ways you
    dishonor you parents? Think deeply, remember them and walk away from them –
    forever. As the world celebrates Mothers’ Day, what pleasant surprise would
    you give to your own mother? A card with great poetry? A hug and a song of
    appreciation for being such a caring mother? A gift no matter how little?
    An unexpected text message? Think of what to do and do it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>God Rewards Honour to Mothers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Who is that teenager whose one major desire is to truncate his or her
    destiny by deliberately cutting short his or her life? Certainly, we don’t
    have such a person among us. We please God when we honour our parents, and
    He in turn, lengthens our lifespan (Col. 3:20; Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:1-3).
    Imagine how much you would make God happy when you pleasantly surprise your
    mother continually with little praise and tokens of appreciation here and
    there, especially as she celebrates one landmark or the other in her life;
    imagine how God would be pleased as you daily shower her love and
    affection, as your statement of honour and deep respect for her; your
    demonstration of unalloyed appreciation of her valuable influence upon your
    life. God says when you do this, you earn for yourself, long useful life.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways can we as teenagers honour our parents?
</p>
<p>
    2. How do you particularly honour your own mother?
</p>
<p>
    3. What could be causes of disrespect to parents among teenagers? How
    should we deal with such causes?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
