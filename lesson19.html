    <strong>Text</strong>
    : Luke 8:26-39
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse</strong>
    : “When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and
    reported this in the town and countryside” - Luke 8:34
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line</strong>
    : No normal person can keep good news to himself or herself without sharing
    it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to begin to share the goodness of Jesus
    Christ in their lives to everyone around them.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    In these days of depressing news, gloom and uncertainty all around, good
    news will be very welcomed and heart lifting.
    <em>
        “The light of the eye rejoices the heart, and a good report makes the
        bones healthy”
    </em>
    (Pro. 15:30 NKJV). What is really good news to a believer? The gospel is
    good news. This news is that Jesus died and rose again to pay the penalty
    for our sins so that we might become children of God through faith in the
    resurrected Christ (Eph. 2:8). We are appointed and anointed to preach and
    proclaim this good tidings to the world (Isa. 61:1-3).
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Jesus chose the twelve to become His disciples (Luke 6:12-16). In
    preparation for the great mission ahead of them, He sent them out because
    He wanted to make sure they understood their mission and the difficulties
    ahead. He allowed them to share in experiences like calming a storm,
    deliverance for a demoniac, etc. (Luke 6:17-9:6). Each of Jesus’ encounters
    taught His disciples about His ministry and what would be required of them
    as they went into the world as His representatives. In our text today, we
    are shown the purpose Jesus had in setting sail from Capernaum in Galilee.
    Jesus was willing to go to great lengths of crossing the land and the great
    sea, to save one tortured soul. The text highlights two very important
    points, that Jesus Christ is Lord and has power against unclean spirits, to
    cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and disease. The story of
    the demoniac is a great illustration of what satanic forces can do to a
    human personality under their control. Jesus came to destroy the work of
    the devil and give us life abundantly (1 John 3:8, John 10:10b). He has
    power over satanic forces; Satan and demons recognize the authority of
    Jesus and obey Him (Luke 8:29, 32).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Prisoner </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We are introduced to the story of this man of Gadarenes, sorely possessed
    and tormented by the devil.
</p>
<p>
    A. The state of the man before his encounter with Jesus Christ was
    described thus (vv.26, 29);
</p>
<p>
    1. Naked
</p>
<p>
    2. Unrestrained
</p>
<p>
    3. Uncontrollable
</p>
<p>
    4. Living among the dead
</p>
<p>
    The man had lost his identity to demons. He bore their name and was
    controlled by their power.
</p>
<p>
    B. The good news is that Christ came to save the lost and set the captives
    free (Luke 19:10, John 3:17, 1 Tim. 1:15). Demons are subject to His power.
    They tremble at His presence. The devil’s power may be great but the Word
    of God is more powerful, for all power belongs to Him (Matt. 28:18).
</p>
<p>
    1. When the demon-possessed man encountered Christ, Christ demonstrated His
    power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of
    sickness and all manner of disease (Mat. 10:1)
</p>
<p>
    2. Jesus meets man at his greatest needs. The state of the man after his
    encounter with Jesus was described thus (LK. 8: 33, 35-36)
</p>
<p>
    a. Delivered, no longer possessed and tormented
</p>
<p>
    b. Seated peacefully at Jesus feet (a disciple), no longer unrestrained or
    uncontrollable
</p>
<p>
    c. Clothed , no longer naked
</p>
<p>
    d. In his right mind, no longer subject to wild and self-destructive
    behaviour
</p>
<p>
    e. Healed holistically- mentally, emotionally, physically, socially and
    spiritually, no longer under the influence of the demonic spirit that made
    him very unstable mentally and emotionally while physically violent.
</p>
<p>
    f. Saved completely (v.36), no longer unsaved and tormented
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This is the Good News!!! “</strong>
    <em>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost</em>
    ” (Luke 19:10, Mat. 18:11)
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Proclaimer </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. What do we do with the Good news? Proclamation is what you do with the
    good news. Good news cannot be hidden or withheld. It is normal to tell or
    share it with people. It will make the headlines. There is no greater tool
    for proclaiming the power of God than the lips of the one who has
    experienced the power of God first hand.
</p>
<p>
    Good news is to be:
</p>
<p>
    1. Proclaimed
</p>
<p>
    2. Preached
</p>
<p>
    3. Published
</p>
<p>
    4. Publicized (Isa. 52:7, 61:1-3, Rom. 10:15)
</p>
<p>
    B. The Proclaimers are:
</p>
<p>
    1. They that fed the swine (Luke 8: 34, 36). They went and told it in the
    city and in the country. Whether in good or bad faith, they proclaimed the
    good news (Phil. 1:15-17). They narrated how and by what means the man was
    delivered.
</p>
<p>
    2. The man who was delivered (vv. 37-39). He reacted in faith and not fear,
    and wanted to go with Jesus, but he commissioned him to Go and Tell.
    “Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto
    thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how
    great things Jesus had done unto him.
</p>
<p>
    He went to
</p>
<p>
    a. His own house, family, neighbours, community
</p>
<p>
    b. Showed the great things God had done for him
</p>
<p>
    c. Published it throughout the whole city.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Discuss practical ways to share the good news with friends and peers.
</p>
<p>
    <em>2. </em>
    Let us sing <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    “<em>What the Lord has done for me I cannot tell it all 3x</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> He saved me and washed me in His Blood</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> So I can shout Hallelujah, I can shout Hallelujah</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> I can shout, Praise the Lord!!</em>
</p>
<p>
    3. <em>Go and Tell</em> the good news!!!
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    Our faith should be more than just coming to Church, fellowshipping and
    receiving blessing. It involves returning to the World and declaring our
    experience with God. Our greatest witness of the power of God is what He
    has done in our lives and our testimonies should be of ongoing and growing
    experience.
</p>
