    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.' "I
    replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my
    mouth.' "The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything
    impure that God has made clean.' - Acts 11:7-9<em></em>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    Our lifestyle and relationship with other believers of other persuasion or
    denomination must be guided by the truth of God’s word and the direction of
    the Spirit and not by the bias of church tradition.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to learn
</p>
<p>
    Cultivate a more open heart in relating with other believers beyond
    denominational boundaries and bias.

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The major event that has characterized the preaching of the Gospel is
    persecution. This however should not pose a limitation or fear in us
    because persecution has proved to be a means of advancing the course of the
    Gospel, strengthening believers’ faith and bringing glory to God. Apostle
    James admonishes us, “My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into
    divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
    patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
    and entire, wanting nothing” (James 1:2-4). Apostle Paul encouraged
    Timothy, “Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
    persecution” (Tim. 3:12-13). The Master says, “These things I have spoken
    to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have
    tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).
    This is the needed encouragement for us.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    When Apostle Peter returned to Jerusalem he was met by members of the
    strong legalistic party in the church of Judea, commonly referred to as
    "the circumcision", who rebuked him for having fellowship with Gentiles and
    eating with them. It seems these Jewish believers did not yet understand
    the relationship between law and grace, Jews and Gentiles, and Israel and
    the church. Most of the ordinary Jewish believers were having a difficult
    time understanding the transition (Acts 21:20). It was not only a matter of
    religion, but also of culture; and cultural habits are very hard to break.
    We must avoid zeal without knowledge. It is good to be zealous, but we must
    add adequate knowledge to be effective and productive in our Christian
    service.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Contention with Peter </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Both the apostles and the brethren in Judea contended with Apostle Peter
    for going to the Gentiles. The expression ‘circumcised believers’ describes
    Jewish Christians who still held to the Law of Moses. They transfer their
    idea of Judaism into Christianity (Acts 10:45; 15:5; 21:20; Gal 2:12). The
    accusation lodged against Peter was that he went into the house of
    uncircumcised men and ate with them. I think they were more concerned with
    Peter eating with them (cf. Mark 2:16; Luke 15:2; Gal 2:12). This gives
    even greater significance to Peter's vision (Acts 10:9-16). Eating with
    someone was a mark of acceptance and fellowship (cf. 1 Cor. 5:11). This
    problem could have caused a serious break in the church if God had not
    given Peter a vision ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Defence of Peter </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Peter narrated the circumstances that led to what had occurred, including
    his vision (Acts 11:5-7), his response to it (Acts 11:8-10), and the trip
    to Cornelius' house (Acts 11:11-14). In recounting what happened next,
    Peter made an important identification of the day of Pentecost with the
    Lord's prediction of the Holy Spirit baptism (Acts 1:4-5). Peter here
    pointedly said so by the phrase at the beginning, "just as we have," (Acts
    10:47) and, "the same gift as He gave us” (Acts 11:17). Referring to what
    happened on the day of Pentecost.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Knowing The Grace of God </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Peter's defense did not rest on what he himself did, but on what God did.
    If God had not made a distinction between Jews and Gentiles, why should
    Peter? The believers in Judea, Jerusalem then recognized that the
    conversion of Gentiles was initiated by God and that they should not stand
    in His way. This response had two significant results. First, it preserved
    the unity of the body of Christ, the church. Second, it bridged the gap
    between the Jews and the Gentiles. It clearly shows that Jesus died for all
    men (humanity). We are all saved by grace (Eph. 2:4-10). <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. The apostles and brethren in Judea contended with Peter for
    fellowshipping and eating with the Gentiles. If you were in Peter’s place
    what would be your reaction?
</p>
<p>
    2. Why did they contend with Peter?
</p>
<p>
    3. Analyze and explain the defence of Peter and the response of the people.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. Peter had to contend with legalists in the church who chided him for
    going into the house of uncircumcised men and eating with them.
</p>
<p>
    2. This kind of segregation and adversarial attitude possess great danger
    to the spread of the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
    3. There are legalists today in the church. They always exhibit certain
    characteristics:
</p>
<p>
    a. They become more, contentious, and judgmental towards others who don't
    do as they do.
</p>
<p>
    b. They lack patience with others who are still growing in faith.
</p>
<p>
    c. They usually like to control others to think and do as they do.
</p>
<p>
    d. They have prideful and condescending attitudes toward other
    denominations who have different persuasions.
</p>
<p>
    4. If you find yourself manifesting any of these attitudes, you may be a
    legalist and you need change of attitude.
