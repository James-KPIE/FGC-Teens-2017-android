				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    As the Church celebrates Father’s Day today, let us go down memory lane to
    trace the origin of father’s day. Mrs. John B. Dodd of Washington D.C was
    the first to propose the idea of a father’s day in the year 1909, to honour
    her father, William Smart, a civil war veteran who raised her and five
    others on a rural farm as a single parent after the death of their mother.
    The first father’s day was observed on June 19, 1910 in Spokane, Washington
    as well as other cities across America. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge
    supported the idea of a national father’s day and in 1966, President Lyndon
    Johnson signed a presidential proclamation declaring 3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday
    of June annually as father’s day. Beyond the commemoration of the day, we
    must acknowledge that honouring our fathers is not just a social conduct or
    value, but a very significant spiritual principle.
</p>
<p>
    More importantly however, obeying and honouring parents is God’s principle
    to long and satisfying life (it may be well with you) and you may live long
    (Eph. 6:3; Ex. 20:12).
</p>
<p>
    It is a spiritual demand. God commands that we obey and honour our parents
    so that it may be well with us and that we may live long (Eph. 6:1-2). So,
    when we obey and honour our fathers, mothers and spiritual parents, we are
    obeying and honouring God. Of course, the attached blessings are well-being
    and long life following automatically.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Parental honour is the first of the laws in the last six of the Ten
    Commandments that define our duty to one another as human beings and to our
    relations. The commandment to honour our parents also falls into the second
    category of Jesus’ great commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
    thyself” (Luke 10:27). In other words, parental honour must be motivated by
    love. Love for our neighbour is certainly not an option. Therefore,
    honouring our dads is a loving imperative that cannot be negotiated and
    should not be compromised. Jesus took up the Pharisees, who had eroded the
    principle of parental honour with their traditions, shirking their
    responsibilities to parents under the guise of their commitment to God
    (Matthew 15:3-6). It is not surprising then that Paul reemphasized the
    principle as a New Testament teaching with benefits (Eph.6:3).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>God Commands Honour to Father</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is no mix up about this matter at all. The Bible is quite clear about
    it. It is an imperative statement: “children, obey your parents in all
    things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord” Col.3:20). Psychologist
    Sigmund Freud provided an excuse for a generation to blame all of their
    problems on their forbearers. This kind of thinking is what have given rise
    to the anger and disrespect in many children against their parents,
    especially dads. But we are of a different breed, we are children of God,
    with God’s Spirit dwelling in us. We will obey God’s command to honour our
    fathers. We cannot be given to the practice of bitterness, contempt, and
    negligence towards our parents, as some children do. We never outgrow God’s
    command to honour our parents. Both our actions and attitudes should reveal
    our real motive for honouring our parents—to bring honour to God. The Greek
    word for honour is <em>timao</em> which means “to prize; to fix a value
    upon; to revere.” Honouring parents requires that we preserve their dignity
    as much as possible. Assisting them with household matters, errands, and
    health issues should never be considered burdensome, but an opportunity to
    be glorify God in our duty towards them. Honouring our dads (especially
    difficult ones) may not always be simple, pleasurable, or even reasonable.
    However, the understanding that God is being honoured when we honour them
    should be a good motivation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>God Rewards Honour to Father</strong>
</p>
<p>
    God’s automatic reward to a child who obeys and honours his father (and
    mother) is a long and a satisfying life. As a teenager, you can and should
    be a source of encouragement to your father. When you are disciplined,
    obedient, and prove responsible and reliable, at home, in school, in church
    and wherever, you make your father proud of you. This is a great honour
    done him and he strives in return to satisfy you to the best of his
    ability. A father would strive to meet the needs of his obedient, loyal and
    responsible children at a huge sacrifice. Imagine how much more God can do.
    When we obey our father (and mother) in all things, God is pleased. We also
    get a bonus of a long and satisfying life (Eph. 6:3; Ex. 20:12). Remember,
    God is honoured when we honour our dads and vice versa. Read 1 Samuel 2:30B
    and meditate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions / Activity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways can we, as teenagers, honour our father (in particular, and
    parents in general)?
</p>
<p>
    2. What could be the causes of disrespect to fathers/parents among
    teenagers, and how can we deal with them?
</p>
<p>
    3. Read Matthew 15:3-6, how does the passage resonate with certain of our
    practices, under the pretext of serving God, which subtly defies the
    principle of parental honour?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div>
					<p>
    1. God demands that children, teenagers inclusive, honour their
    father/parents at all times. Waning societal values and faulty concepts and
    philosophies that encourage subtle disrespect for fathers do not change
    God’s imperative to honour our dads.
</p>
<p>
    2. This is the secret to living a long and rewarding life.
</p>
<p>
    3. Our memory verse emphatically elucidate on our topic of the day.
