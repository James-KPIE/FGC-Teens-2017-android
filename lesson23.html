				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Pentecost Sunday was the day Jesus Christ baptized His early disciples with
    the Holy Ghost in Jerusalem. The experience was the Holy Spirit coming and
    resting upon the disciples as tongues of fire, and they all began to speak
    with strange (new) tongues – languages they never knew or could speak
    before. Upon this baptism, the disciples received power to boldly preach
    the gospel of Jesus Christ first in Jerusalem, then all over Judea, and on
    to Samaria, and to the larger world (Acts 1:8, 2), and to live bold,
    selfless and fruitful Christian life thereafter. The apostle, beginning
    with Peter, preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost everywhere they went
    witnessing Christ. That same baptism has been available to all Christians
    since then till this day. You too can receive Him and begin to live a bold,
    selfless, fruitful and profitable Christian life to the glory of God. All
    you need is to sincerely desire Him and earnestly ask God to do it in your
    life. He would do it for you.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The feast of Pentecost was one of the major Jewish annual festivals. It was
    also called the feast of Weeks (Exo. 34:22, Deut. 16:10, 16; 2 Chro. 8:13).
    It was celebrated fifty days after the feast of Passover. Hence it was
    called Pentecost. The feast celebrated at the end of grain harvest (Exo.
    23:16), when the first-fruits of harvest were presented to God (Lev.
    23:17). The feast of Pentecost came by again not long after Jesus had
    ascended into heaven, having told His disciples (about 120 of them) to
    gather in Jerusalem and wait for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It was that
    day that the Lord chose to baptize His disciples with the Holy Ghost,
    thereby fulfilling Prophet Joel’s prophecy in Joel 2:28-29. “And it shall
    come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh and
    your sons and you daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream
    dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and
    upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit.” The event is
    vividly recorded in Acts 2. Pentecost symbolizes for the Church, the
    beginning of God’s harvest of souls in the world.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit Come The Disciples</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The disciples had gather (in the upper room) in Jerusalem as Jesus
    commanded them to do; they were in unison expectant of the “…promise of the
    Father” (Acts 1:4) (the baptism of the Holy Ghost) as they prayed and
    waited. Then suddenly, a rushing wind from heaven filled the house where
    they were with a sound and cloven tongue like fire sat upon each of them –
    this was the baptism of the Holy Spirit – they were all filled with the
    Holy Spirit and they began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave
    them utterances (they began to speak new languages that the Spirit enabled
    them to speak. Please take note that the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is
    one and the same. The Third Person of the Godhead/Trinity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Peter Preaches by The Power of The Holy Ghost</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the disciples spoke strange languages, many who gathered to hear them
    were amazed, for they each heard them speak in his own language. So, they
    wondered what was happening, but some took to mockery of the disciples. So
    Peter, (by the power of the Holy Ghost), stood up to preach (his first
    sermon) to the people. He made them realize that the disciples did not
    speak out of drunkenness, but that what they were witnessing was the
    fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy (Joel 2:28-32): “And it shall come to pass
    afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh and your sons and
    your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young
    men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in
    those days will I pour out My Spirit…And it shall come to pass that
    whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved…” Acts 2:37-41
    tell us that the people were pricked in their heart (having been convicted
    by the Holy Ghost) and they yielded to Peter’s alter call. The record is
    that on that same Pentecost day, about three thousand people were saved!
