					<p>
    <strong>Text</strong>
    : Luke 7:36-50
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse</strong>
    : “and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his
    feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and
    poured perfume on them. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he
    said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching
    him and what kind of woman she is — that she is a sinner." - Luke 7:38-39
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line</strong>
    : Faith in Jesus Christ is never ashamed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will help the teens to go all out in doing exploits for God
    without being ashamed.<strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Merle Fossum, said that “a pervasive sense of shame is the ongoing premise
    that one is fundamentally bad, inadequate, defective, unworthy or not fully
    valid as a human being.” Shame defines that nagging feeling that you do not
    measure up to the person you ought to be, that persistent feeling that you
    are not acceptable, good enough or that you are less than the good person
    you are supposed to be. Shame may not be a bad thing altogether. There’s a
    shame that prods us to want get in touch with the beautiful part of
    ourselves. It could be a caution that we could be better than what we are
    at the moment. The story of the woman in our text illustrates this kind
    shame, and how she turned her shame into a beautiful thing.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    The woman was a notorious sinner, who was stigmatized by men. However, the
    baggage of shame could not prevent her from showing her love for Jesus. She
    reached out to the Saviour so lovingly. She must have met Jesus in one of
    the Master’s itinerant outreaches and as it was customary of Him, He
    reached out to her. She must have felt really loved by this man who dared
    to love her in spite of her filth; this man who accepted her just as she
    was, while she had suffered rejection and been an object of ridicule from
    all and sundry all this while.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Shameful Woman </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have many words that describe the word shameful: to be disgraceful,
    deplorable, dishonorable, blameworthy, ignoble, scandalous, disgusting,
    odious, immoral and the woman in the text was described as such. She is
    described as<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. A sinner with a bad reputation. She was notorious and stigmatized:
</p>
<p>
    1. ‘woman in the city, which was a sinner’ (NKJV)
</p>
<p>
    2. ‘lived a sinful life (NIV)
</p>
<p>
    3. ‘town harlot’ (MSG)
</p>
<p>
    4. ‘Certain immoral woman from that city’ (NLT).
</p>
<p>
    5. ‘A woman of the streets, a prostitute’ (TLB).
</p>
<p>
    B. A social outcast, rejected, unwanted even by the religious leaders of
    her days. She was denied help by those who should be in the position to
    help her.
</p>
<p>
    1. Sin brings about guilt, shame, tears, condemnation (Psa. 69:1-7)
</p>
<p>
    2. Shame is extreme humiliation and remorse; a despairing of life from
    abject embarrassment. With shame, a person palpably feels his/her depravity
    in vivid self-realization. We flinch at looking so closely at our
    inclination to sin because of the feeling deep sense of shame and so turn
    our eye in order to temporarily ease the pain.
</p>
<p>
    3. Shame could be healthy or unhealthy. Most of us carry both kinds of
    shame, and often tend towards the unhealthy one. The truth is more often
    the feeling of shame is distorted and exaggerated either by us by others
    who judge us. This was the case of this woman.
</p>
<p>
    However, she made a decision to turn her mess into a message. In her shame
    she turned the Saviour, with godly sorrow that led to repentance (Jer. 3:3;
    6:15a, Ezek. 16:63, 2 Cor. 7:9-10).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Shameless Faith </strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the woman met Christ, her shameful life was transformed into a
    shameless faith. Her shame became a thing of the past. She acknowledged
    that she was a sinner and that she needed help. She finally got transformed
    and her story changed. She became bold about her faith. She was not ashamed
    of declaring her love for Christ. She didn’t mind the wagging tongues and
    the judging eyes. She now had a shameless faith. She demonstrated her
    shameless faith by:
</p>
<p>
    A. Coming to Jesus in absolute surrender (v.37).
</p>
<p>
    B. Worshiping Him with affection and awe (v.38).
</p>
<p>
    C. Defying judgmental opinion about her person. She was more preoccupied
    with pleasing Christ than what people will say (v.39).
</p>
<p>
    D. Declaring her love unashamedly for Jesus in gratitude for the
    forgiveness of her sins. (v.47)
</p>
<p>
    E. Receiving the justification of Jesus over the condemnation of
    people(v.48 )
</p>
<p>
    F. Absolutely trusting Christ for her complete deliverance and peace
    (v.50).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. In what ways can shame be a barrier in coming to Christ?
</p>
<p align="left">
    2. What do we see that showed the depth of her love of Christ?
</p>
<p>
    3. In what ways can we be ashamed of the gospel?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    God’s love for us is so great that He looks beyond our sin and shame and
    hears our faintest cries. No matter how far and deep we have gone His love
    covers all. The woman with the alabaster jar understood this and that’s why
    she didn’t hold back in showing her love to Jesus, even in front of prying
    eyes and prattling mouths. Paul declared, “
    <em>
        For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of
        God to salvation for everyone who believes….”
    </em>
    (Rom. 1:16 NKJV). This should be our declaration too! We should unashamedly
raise the banner of Christ (through our and love) for the world to see.    <em></em>
