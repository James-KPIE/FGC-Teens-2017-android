			<h2>Lesson 46</h2><h2>Make a Joyful Noise</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock of
    our salvation. Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with
    music and song.” - Psalm 95:1-2
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    We must always respond to the call to rejoice in the Lord at all times.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    At the end of this lesson teens will learn to appreciate the significance
    of joy in Christian living.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    Our topic “make a joyful noise” is an imperative statement. It is not a
    conditional disposition. It didn’t say make a joyful noise when you feel
    good or when you hit a jackpot or whatever reason you may have to do it.
    Joy is an unconditional virtue. It is not something you feel because of, it
    is what you express in spite of. Joy is a fruit of the Spirit that defies
    surrounding situations. You don’t feel to rejoice, you choose to rejoice,
    because the Holy Spirit is inside of you and He fills your heart with joy.
    More importantly, to make a joyful noise is not a matter of feeling, it’s a
    matter of obedience. Paul said to the Philippians, Rejoice in the Lord
    always. I will say it again: Rejoice! (Phil. 4:4). So when the psalmist
    say, “Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord” (v.1), it is a bugle blast
    that must be obeyed.

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    This Psalm without a title is though attributed to David was believed to
    have been composed during the time of the captivity. The author of the
    Hebrew epistle also in following the common opinion attributed the Psalm to
    David (cf. Heb 4:3-7).
</p>
<p>
    The Psalm is a solemn invitation to the people to praise God from a sense
    of his great goodness; and to be attentive to divine instructions. The
    psalmist warned the nation of Israel not to repeat the folly of unbelief
    that cost its ancestors the promised rest in the land. This warning was
    prompted by the incidents at Rephidim where the people murmured, strove
    (Meribah) and tested (Massah) God (cf. Exo. 17; Num. 20:1-13, Psa. 81:7;
    106:32). So God swore that they would not enter the land, but that they
    would perish in the wilderness, except for the younger the younger
    generation.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Rejoice in God’s Eminence </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We rejoice because God is God. He is our God. He created us. He created us
    for His pleasure (Rev. 4:11). If His other creatures are showing forth His
    praises (Psa. 19:1-3), then we that He created after His likeness must do
    more. He is God, in all generations and for eternity. The psalmist writes,
    “Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light
    of your presence, LORD” (Ps. 89:15). You don’t just make joyful sound, you
    must learn how make it. You learn it in the presence of God, in intimate
    fellowship with the Holy Spirit. In Psalm 16:11, we learn a significant
    truth: “You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in
    your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.” The revelation
    to the path of life, is to be filled with joy in His presence. It is in His
    presence we discover His eminence. When we make a joyful noise, we do it
    with songs and psalms in our hearts (Eph. 5:19, Psa. 105:2), with our
    voices (Psa. 149:1), with instruments (Psa. 150:4) everywhere, lifting up
    holy hands (1 Tim. 2:8).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Rejoice in God’s Benevolence </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We rejoice in His benevolence, in what He has done for us. Is there anyone
    God has not done anything good in the past for? No! Except those who will
    say God has not done enough for them. The Bible says, He daily loads with
    benefits (Ps.68:19). He bears our burdens, day by day. For each day, Hear
    bears us in His arms. God's benefits are not few nor light, they are loads;
    neither are they intermittent, but they come daily; nor are they confined
    to one or two favourites, for all flesh, whether they acknowledge it or
    not, can say, “he loads us with benefits.” This was what Israel could not
    acknowledge at Rephidim (Exo. 17:1-7) what God had done for them. First,
    God heard their cry. He sent them a leader and a deliverer in Moses. He
    shielded their land of Goshen from the plagues (Exo.9:26) He sent upon
    Egypt. He gave them favour before the mourning Egyptians who paid them
    their 430 years wages. The pursuing Pharaoh and his chariots could not
    catch up with Israel. God opened up the Red Sea for their escape and better
    still all their stubborn pursuers perished in the Red Sea. For 30 days they
    were not hungry (Exo. 16:1). They murmured, they argued, they complained,
    they tested Him, they tried His patience. We must learn to take count of
    what God has done for us, so that our hearts won’t become callous with
    ingratitude. If we can’t recount anything, we can at least recall that He
    saved us from sin and death. And that is more than enough.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Rejoice in God’s Providence </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We rejoice in God’s providence. The providence of God may be defined as His
    guardianship and care for His creatures and creation. God not only looks
    ahead and attempts to make provision for his goals, but infallibly
    accomplishes what he sets out to do. The Bible says, He works out
    everything in conformity with the purpose of his will (Eph.1:11). Whatever
    challenges or confrontations you might be going through now should not
    debar you from rejoicing in God, because we know that in all things God
    works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to
    his purpose (Rom. 8:28). The present troubles are not even comparable to
    where the Lord is taking you (Rom. 8:18). His thoughts and plans and
    purposes for you are full of pleasantries. In fact, presently “He watches
    over” (Psa. 95:7b) and cares for you (1 Pet. 5:7). Sing praises to this
    great God. “Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
    greatly increase” (Job 8:7).]

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. How would you describe the attitude of the Israelites who are quick to
    forget God’s mercies and miracles on their behalf, and go into a murmuring
    frenzy at the slightest disappointment?
</p>
<p>
    2. What does mean to say, “we make a joyful noise in spite of, not because
    of”?
</p>
<p>
    3. Where’s the balance between not denying our feelings and yet not living
    by feelings, but by faith?
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. The call to make a joyful noise of praises and worship unto the Lord is
    a lifestyle of the believer.
</p>
<p>
    2. We experience the fullness of joy in God’s presence, we therefore must
    cultivate an intimacy that keeps us connected with the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    3. We can pray the same prayer as Paul, “Now may the God of hope fill you
    with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the
    power of the Holy Spirit” (Rom. 15:13).
