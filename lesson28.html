			<h2>Lesson 28</h2><h2>Simon is Rebuked</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Acts 8:9-25
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you
    could buy the gift of God with money!” - Acts 8:20
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line: </strong>
    The power of God is received through the Holy Ghost after salvation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective: </strong>
    This lesson will give more understanding to the teens that money or
    position cannot buy the power of God.
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    After salvation, the spiritual growth is a process or a journey expressed
    as in Rom. 12:2 (NIV) “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this
    world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be
    able to test and approve what God's will is – his good, pleasing and
    perfect will”. Salvation is a means to an end and not an end in itself. The
    spiritual life of a believer needs to be nurtured. Simon the sorcerer’s
    (known as Simon Magus in church tradition) attitude was a display of
    spiritual childishness; an act of an unregenerate mind who thought the
    power of God was for sale<em>.</em><strong></strong>
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    After the death of Stephen, persecution arose against the church and some
    believers fled Jerusalem. Phillip, a co-labourer with Stephen moved to
    Samaria and launched out with the gospel of Christ with signs and wonders
    following his ministry. Phillip’s new work nullified the counterfeit
    magical arts of Simon the sorcerer that was mesmerizing the Samaritans
    before the arrival of Phillip. It was a new dawn for the people of Samaria.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Confounding of Samaria </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For a long time, Simon Magus deceived the people of Samaria, earning
    himself fame and fortune on account of his magical power. Sorcery, which is
    strongly condemned by God (Deut. 18:9-13), was common in the ancient world.
    While some acts and demonstrations were no more than illusions of the mind,
    others were empowered by Satan in an attempt to discredit the power of God
    (Thess. 2:9). Captured by the spell of Simon’s sorcery, the people of
    Samaria, both great and small, dignified and even deified him.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Conversion of Samaria</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Counterfeit thrives in the absence of the original. With the arrival of
    Philip from Jerusalem, backed by the power of God, Simon’s befuddlement of
    Samaritans came to an end. Those who have been enchanted by the sorcerer,
    received and believed the Gospel and became Christians. Confounded by the
    ministry of Phillip, Simon himself submitted to the higher power of the
    gospel of Christ and he admitted to become one of the believers. What is
    not certain is if Simon genuinely was saved, as the state of his heart
    became later apparent in the story (vv.18-20). It is not impossible that he
    may have feigned his conversion to safeguard his popularity with the
    people, who have now shifted base to Phillip’s ministry. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Confinement Of Simon</strong>
</p>
<p>
    News of what was happening in Samaria got to the leaders of the church in
    Jerusalem. So Peter and John were sent to Samaria to give Philip some
    support. On arrival, they saw the need to introduce the baptism of the Holy
    Spirit to the people. This they did by laying on of hands, seeing this, the
    spiritual blindness and immaturity of Simon Magus was eposed. He thought
    the power of God was for sale like magic and he offered money in exchange
    for God’s power. Taken aback and sorely infuriated by Simon’s impious and
    insolent behaviour, Peter harshly condemned his act and put him in his
    place. This act of Simon shows conclusively that his motives in becoming
    associated with the church were not genuine. It was from Simon’s act that
    the term ‘simony’ was derived, which denotes, the buying and selling of
    ecclesiastical privileges, appointments or church offices, a practice which
    became popular when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman
    empire in the 4<sup>th</sup> Century A.D.

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What does Simon’s suspicious conversion tell us about people’s motives
    in coming to church today?
</p>
<p>
    2. What are the activities of the prototypes of Simon in the church today?
</p>
<p>
    3. How can believers today avoid being victims of those in the likeness of
    Simon in the church?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    The power of God is not for sale. That is one big lesson we have learnt
    today. People come into church for different motives and so they may be in
    church and have all the forms being a Christian, but their heart may be far
    from the gospel of Christ. Simon Magus typifies those who Paul described as
    acting religious, but rejecting the power that could make them godly (2
    Tim. 3:5, NLT). Peter’s unreserved rebuke of Simon is an indication that
    the church should not condone or encourage those who have infiltrated the
    church to make merchandize of the Gospel. The Christian faith must not
    permit charlatans to rubbish the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are to contend
    for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints (Jude 3) in
    faithfully living out the Gospel and in resisting those who make mockery of
    the Gospel through distortion and deception. Christians must take
    cognisance of Paul’s warning in 2 Thess. 2:9-10 of the end-time activities
    of the messengers of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles,
    signs and wonders, and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are
    perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be
    saved.
