			<h2>Lesson 42</h2><h2>Sharing with Sincerity</h2>
			<div id="first">
				<h3>Lesson Starts</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    <strong>Text:</strong>
    Acts 4:34-5:10
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Memory Verse:</strong>
    “Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not
    reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” - 2
    Corinthians 9:7
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong>
    We must be sincere with the message in sharing and preaching of the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Objective:</strong>
    At the end of this lesson, teens should be able to share their love, gifts
    and endowment with others as they preach the gospel to them.
</p>

				<h3>Lesson Introduction</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    All that surround the birth, death, burial and resurrection of our Lord
    Jesus Christ are not only unique but transcend the ordinary. Hundred
    percent God, born hundred percent man, died hundred percent man and rose
    hundred percent God. Jesus gave His life to humanity that we might have
    life in abundance (Jn. 10:10).
</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Lesson Insight/Biblical Background</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
    So much had happened since the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The
    apostles were still basking in the euphoria of the Holy Ghost. The church
    was increasing daily in multiple thousands. Miracles and healings were
    being wrought by the hands of the apostles. The bond of fellowship was
    growing stronger and more intimate. The apostolic grace was waxing
    stronger. The Gospel was spreading wider and the wave of the new move was
    the talk of the town. The religious leaders of the day became uncomfortable
    and unleashed persecution on the Church. They targeted their leaders (Peter
    and John), arrested and imprisoned them. But persecution only strengthened
    their unity and bolstered their confidence. Eventually, Peter and John were
    released, with threats from the Jewish leaders, as they couldn’t find
    anything on them. The church resisted the threats of the authorities with
    passionate and powerful corporate prayers. This sparked another bout of
    revival with the release of so much grace, as the apostles continued to
    proclaim Christ with increased fervour.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>

<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Sharing with Grace</strong>
</p>
<p>
    With increased grace, came increased power, and with an increased power,
    came an increased church, with an increased church, increased needs.
    However, as the needs increased, love also increased to cater for those
    needs. The church had prayed for a boldness in their profession of the
    gospel, and God graciously granted their request. But the boldness of the
    church in its profession was also practiced with regard to its possessions.
    What they were doing wasn’t new, because that was how they started when the
    church was born in Acts 2. The difference here was that the church had
    become larger and as such, the great grace unleashed by the Spirit
    motivated the saints to go the extra mile in meeting the needs of others in
    the fold. Further, earlier they had sold their goods as needs arose and
    personally met them. But now, with a much larger church and more needs,
    they sold their possessions and brought the money to the apostles, leaving
    it to them to administer the funds. It is much easier to be motivated to
    give to one’s neighbour, whose needs are immediately evident to us, than it
    is to give to those we do not even know. There had to have been a high
    level of confidence in the apostles for the money to have been laid at
    their feet. This kind of disposition wasn’t just a function of sheer
    generosity, it must have been motivated by the Holy Spirit. A notable
    example of such bigheartedness, was Barnabas (4:36), who would later become
    Paul’s missionary companion. He sold a piece of land he owned in Cyprus and
    brought the proceeds from the sale to the Apostles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Sharing with Greed</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The notorious couple, in our story, Ananias and Sapphira, were not as
    gracious as Barnabas. Indeed they did sell their land just like some others
    had done, but they conspired to deceive the Church. They decided that they
    would some of the proceeds of the sale to the apostles, and keep back a
    small amount for themselves. They lied about the amount they gave. They
    made it look like they were giving the entire proceeds from the sale. They
    wanted to make an impression. In the real sense they didn’t have to lie or
    be deceitful. It wasn’t as if they were under compulsion to give a
    particular amount. It was their decision to sell the land and donate the
    sale to the welfare purse of the church. They could have been sincere and
    transparent about what they wanted to give. If they didn’t want to give
    everything, it wouldn’t have been a problem with the apostles. But keeping
    part of the money, and coming to show off as if they were giving
    everything, was a duplicitous behaviour. They didn’t just offend the
    apostles or the church, they actually sinned against the Holy Spirit.
    Peter, who probably by discernment, knew what the couple had done,
    confronted the husband, “How is it that Satan has so filled your heart that
    you have lied to the Holy Spirit” (Acts 5:3). Ananias immediately dropped
    dead. His wife showed up three hours later and Peter confronted her as
    well. She had the chance to repent, but she chose keep up with the lie.
    Peter then pointed out that she had conspired with Ananias against the Lord
    and would share his fate, at which point Sapphira fell and died (Acts
    5:10). As the grace of God increased, so did His power and glory. The
    greater His grace in our lives, the more of His fear (reverence) we should
    have in our lives. In the hymn,<em> Amazing Grace, </em>John Newton wrote,
    “Twas grace that taught my heart to fear.” Ananias and Sapphira, took the
grace of God for granted and they paid the price of their hypocrisy.    <strong></strong>

<p>
    <strong>Discussion Questions/Activities</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. What has God given us that He expects us to give back?
</p>
<p>
    2. Humanly speaking, is it really possible to give without expecting
    something back in return?
</p>
<p>
    3. Discuss how and what we can sincerely share with others in Christ Jesus
    without being carnal?
</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
					<div><p>
    1. There’s so much hypocrisy going on in the church today. People like to
    put up appearances. They seek for cheap popularity and vain glory on the
    platform of deception and phony piety. This was exactly what Ananias and
    Sapphira typified.
</p>
<p>
    2. Barnabas’ sacrifice and labour of love genuinely demonstrate what should
    motivate our giving to meet the needs of others in the body Christ. There
    was no trace of fleshly pride in what he did. His only thought was the need
    of other Christians and the glory of God.
</p>
<p>
    3. Our acts of love, should not be done to impress people, patronize church
    leadership or score a point. We should be motivated by sincere love and
    faith in God the Rewarder (Heb.11:6), knowing fully well that “God is not
    unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you
    have helped his people and continue to help them” (Heb. 6:10).
